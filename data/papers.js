    "abstract": "Controllable 3D part generation is pivotal for digital asset creation, yet existing methods lack the flexibility to accommodate diverse user workflows requiring varying levels of control. In this paper, we introduce FlexPart, a unified image-to-3D part generation framework that supports variable-granularity geometric conditions within a single model. By seamlessly integrating heterogeneous inputs, ranging from sparse points to dense bounding boxes and masks, via gated adaptive modulation, FlexPart unlocks a powerful cross-modal synergy. We also propose an asymmetric geometric guidance mechanism that leverages strong spatial priors to align representations across granularities, improving geometric consistency and facilitating inter-task synergy. Under mask conditioning on PartVerseXL, FlexPart reduces Part CD by 16.6% relative to TripoSG + SAM3D and by 10.5% relative to OmniPart, while maintaining competitive whole-mesh quality.

    "abstract": "Robotic foundation models are typically evaluated through costly closed-loop rollouts, which motivates cheap offline proxies for model capability. The Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) suggests that as representations improve, different modalities such as vision and language converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. We ask whether motion trajectories form another such modality: as embodied models become more capable, should their sensory representations converge toward the structure of physical motion? To examine this, we propose Sensorimotor Alignment ($S^2$), a training-free offline metric that measures how well a model's sensory representation aligns with the geometry of physical motion. We find that $S^2$ correlates positively with downstream robot task success across embodied model families, making it a low-cost offline proxy for prioritizing models before closed-loop evaluation. $S^2$ can also identify promising vision-language model (VLM) backbones even before costly fine-tuning into vision-language-action models (VLAs). Beyond this correlation, $S^2$ offers representation-level explanations for phenomena observed in VLAs and world action models (WAMs). With $S^2$, we extend PRH to embodied models and make sensorimotor alignment empirically measurable, offering insight into why an embodied model succeeds beyond its closed-loop success rate.",

    "abstract": "Video foundation models have advanced rapidly in understanding and generating visual sequences, while video world models seek to capture the underlying dynamics of the world they depict. Despite their different objectives, both concern the relationship between video observations and an evolving world. This survey adopts world modeling as a unifying lens for examining these developments. Viewing an observed video as a partial, lossy, and temporally ordered projection of a latent temporal world, we organize the literature around four complementary operations: reading infers world properties from observed video; writing synthesizes video from specified or learned world conditions; sharing integrates understanding and generation through common modeling mechanisms; and interacting predicts and updates world states under actions and evolving observations. This perspective distinguishes temporal coherence in observed or generated sequences from consistency in the underlying world state. Across tasks, representations, models, datasets, and benchmarks, we trace a shift in emphasis from clip-level recognition and perceptual fidelity toward persistent state, controllable evolution, physical and causal validity, and evaluation grounded in interaction and downstream decisions, and we distill the open challenges that follow.",

    "abstract": "Test-time scaling has emerged as a key inference strategy for reasoning models, where a model generates a large number of candidate solutions in the hope of finding at least one correct solution. Running all candidate solutions to completion can be computationally demanding, so recent work prunes the candidate pool after generating only a short prefix, committing further computation only to the surviving candidates. Existing pruning strategies divide broadly into two categories: Quality-based methods assign a score to each partial solution and discard those predicted to ultimately lead to an incorrect final solution, while diversity-based methods select partial solutions that follow different reasoning trajectories and are therefore likely to cover different final solutions. The tension between these two objectives is an instance of exploration versus exploitation, yet little to no prior work on pruning exposes this trade-off directly, let alone optimizes it. In this paper, we introduce a pruning procedure that addresses this trade-off directly by optimizing pass@$k$ over the selected solution pool. In particular, it chooses the pool to maximize the probability that at least one of its partial solutions, when continued to completion, yields a correct answer. Because this objective simultaneously rewards high-quality partial solutions and penalizes redundancy among them, quality and diversity are naturally balanced by the criterion itself rather than through separate ad-hoc design choices. On eight open-weight reasoning models, our method outperforms existing quality-based and diversity-based pruning strategies. The gains are particularly pronounced when the pruning procedure keeps a moderate number of partial solutions for continued generation, highlighting the value of directly balancing quality and diversity during pruning.",

    "abstract": "Auditing whether a text-to-image (T2I) model was fine-tuned on a particular image collection is difficult: a model can absorb collection-level visual characteristics without reproducing training images. Proactive dataset-use auditing plants a shared signal in a dataset before release, then later checks whether that signal appears in a suspect model's generated outputs. Existing approaches often trade off verifiability, fidelity, robustness, and deployability. We introduce $\\textbf{SpectralCanary}$, which uses a smooth low-pass mask to blend a fixed canary image into every collection image while leaving captions unchanged and requiring neither auxiliary generation nor per-image optimization. A lightweight verifier detects the transferred signal in suspect-model outputs. Across eight tests on the Pokemon dataset and three realistic data transformations, spanning two architectures families, SpectralCanary achieves the highest average per-generation TPR@$1\\%$ FPR ($91.1\\%$) and fixed threshold model-level accuracy using 30 generations ($94.8\\%$) among the evaluated methods. Across five datasets spanning artistic, medical, satellite, and fashion domains with SD3.5, SpectralCanary averages $92.4\\%$ per-generation TPR@$1\\%$ FPR while preserving the released images (SSIM $0.989$, LPIPS $0.022$) with a near-zero mean change FID (mean $Δ$FID $0.05$) across datasets. Matched-energy ablations on Pokemon and ROCOv2 support our design choice, low-frequency placement transfers more reliably compared to mid/high-frequency placement. Under the evaluated adaptive attacks, the most effective removal requires aggressive modification and incurs more than $25$ $Δ$FID points. These results identify low-frequency visual signals as effective carriers for collection-level T2I audit traces.",

    "abstract": "Wrong automatic routing of an IT support ticket can cost more than human triage. We evaluate cost-aware abstention as an offline, cost-conditional readiness assessment: select a routing policy on calibration data under explicit costs, then evaluate that frozen policy once on held-out test data. On a public 47,837-ticket, eight-class corpus, we compare four trained non-LLM classifiers with four large language models under zero- and few-shot prompting. Under the illustrative cost model (c_ok, c_triage, c_wrong) = (0, 1, 5), TF-IDF with logistic regression and a threshold of 0.60 selected on calibration reduces test cost from 0.763 to 0.472, a 38.1% relative reduction (paired ratio-bootstrap 95% CI [35.7%, 40.4%]), while lowering wrong routes from 15.3% to 3.5%. Frozen calibration-selected policies also beat both always-route and always-defer on held-out test data in 14 of 16 settings in a post-hoc cost-parameter analysis. The strongest prompted configuration reaches 0.477 accuracy on a stratified 1,000-ticket test subset, versus 0.879 for fine-tuned DistilBERT on the same tickets. Isotonic lowers expected calibration error without reliably improving discrimination: GPT-4o-mini few-shot has one confidence value before and after recalibration and correctness AUROC 0.500. We therefore report correctness AUROC and tie-aware risk-coverage area alongside ECE. At the analytically derived break-even probability 0.80, seven prompted configurations defer all tickets; Haiku few-shot routes only 19/1,000. An LLM-only agreement control and margin/entropy rejection baselines further separate calibration from discrimination. The findings are scoped to this dataset, prompt design, model endpoints, and illustrative costs; the work is an evaluation framework, not a new abstention algorithm or universal deployment certification.",

    "abstract": "Meta-reinforcement learning aims to train agents that adapt quickly to unseen tasks from limited interaction, but this requires representing task evidence over long interaction histories. Classical recurrent agents compress experience into hidden states, while transformer-based agents retrieve from past trajectories at quadratic memory and computation cost. In this work, we propose Memory-Enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (METTA) for meta-reinforcement learning. It decomposes the fast adaptation phase into two temporal scales: a causal neural memory performs fine-grained within-episode adaptation with linear sequence complexity, while compact episode-level summaries support long-range cross-episode task inference without attending over the full interaction history. Moreover, equipping agents with neural memory provides sufficient expressive capacity and test-time training capability, enabling effective adaptation to unseen held-out tasks and task families at meta-test time. On unseen held-out Meta-World ML10/45 test environments, METTA achieves a success rate over $50\\%$ while maintaining a low training budget and short wall-clock time. On long-context sparse-reward PointMaze tasks, it outperforms transformer-based baselines by exhibiting more structured exploration behavior. These results show that METTA provides an efficient path toward more adaptive and scalable long-context meta-RL.",

    "abstract": "Frontier coding agents are becoming increasingly adept at 3D modeling. Yet, they still face challenges when building objects meant to be assembled in the physical world, often creating invalid assemblies with floating, colliding, or disconnected parts. We argue that providing agents with tools for assembling builds and verifying their physical feasibility is sufficient for them to produce physically valid assemblies that still adhere to input prompts. Focusing on the domain of LEGO brick builds, we present BrickWright, a framework for generating physically feasible brick builds from text or image prompts using pre-trained agents, where a build is physically feasible if it uses only real parts, has no colliding or floating parts, and forms a connected structure if possible. BrickWright guides agents to create builds by writing code with BrickLayer, a Python toolkit with two main components: an ergonomic brick assembly API that halves inference cost compared to working in raw LDraw, and a validator that provides feedback on physical feasibility. Whereas baseline agents achieve physical validity rates ranging from only 9% (GPT-6 Luna) to 69% (GPT-6 Astra), BrickWright-guided agents achieve 100% validity on a sample of 512 prompts, while improving prompt adherence for lightweight agents and maintaining it for stronger agents. Additionally, they outperform specialized models on the text-to-brick task. Code is available on our project page: https://avalovelace1.github.io/brickwright/",

We introduce \\bench{}, an executable benchmark for evaluating unsafe execution, safety boundaries, and evidence recovery in LLM agents under missing evidence. It contains 300 matched unsafe/safe task pairs across six domains. By systematically suppressing critical facts, the benchmark measures unsafe execution under critical evidence omission and determines the minimum observed failure cardinality, including failures with full evidence and cases with no observed failure after exhaustive testing. An independent audit tool tests whether agents seek missing facts and then withhold prohibited actions while completing permissible tasks. The benchmark reveals substantial variation across the ten models in omission robustness, evidence acquisition, and appropriate action. Resistance to missing evidence does not necessarily translate into useful recovery. Recovery access reduces unsafe execution for all ten models, but agents differ in whether they actively obtain the missing facts and use them to act appropriately in both worlds.",

Purifying such inputs requires deciding when to intervene and preserving the visual cues needed for 3D generation, while leaving clean inputs unchanged. We introduce Gate3DGen, a selective pre-processing model that gates image inputs to existing 3D generators without retraining them. A degradation-aware router bypasses inputs classified as clean and extracts features to guide purification of the remaining inputs. Conditioned on these features, a 3D-oriented one-step purifier purifies degraded inputs with spatial losses that encourage preservation of object identity, contours, and textural cues. To provide paired supervision, we construct a synthetic data engine that renders clean views of 3D assets and synthesises composite degradations. On the synthetic benchmark, the purifier improves image fidelity and downstream 3D geometry in only 2.3s on average, reducing TRELLIS.2 mesh distance by 61.5% relative to degraded inputs. VLM evaluation and human preferences on real photographs further support identity preservation and degradation correction. More demos and code are available at https://supra-3d.github.io/gate3dgen.",

    "abstract": "Many recent open-weight language models use n-gram embedding tables to improve performance. These tables store learned representations of short token sequences, such as pairs or triples of consecutive tokens, which the model retrieves during processing. However, they can require substantial memory: DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash, for example, allocates 196 billion parameters to its Engram n-gram memory. We therefore investigate whether this memory cost can be reduced while preserving the performance improvement that the tables provide. We propose storing n-gram embeddings at low precision and systematically investigate different quantization methods and bit allocations across tables. Across nanochat-, Llama-, and GPT-2-family models trained from scratch, four-bit tables save approximately 75% of table memory while preserving more than 99% of the validation-loss improvement from adding the tables. Using fewer bits leads to a larger drop in performance, although we find that a short fine-tuning phase recovers a significant part of this loss. In addition, reinvesting the saved memory in larger tables can improve performance beyond that of the original full-precision tables while still using less memory. These table memory savings also extend to large existing models: on DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash and Qwen3.8-Flash-Next, low-bit tables save 47-55% of table memory, with perplexity increases of less than 1.2% and largely preserved downstream task performance. These findings establish low-bit precision as a practical way to reduce the memory requirements of n-gram embeddings and use the saved capacity to improve model performance.",

Camera-aware models remove this assumption by predicting a per-pixel ray field. However, they represent different camera geometries using a single fixed basis to capture both the overall camera projection and its finer variations. We argue that camera geometry can be viewed as having a hierarchy of complexity for representing rays. We present OmniRay, a feed-forward model whose Ray Module is composed of three components: a monotone radial base that captures radially symmetric structure, a spherical-harmonic residual for smooth deviations from it, and a free-form residual for remaining local variation. These components are composed as successive rotations on the sphere, allowing the representation to accommodate diverse camera geometries. Given a single image, OmniRay predicts a ray direction and an up-to-scale radial distance for every pixel, from which a 3D point cloud is recovered without needing camera information at inference time. Extensive experiments across different camera configurations demonstrate that OmniRay establishes a new state-of-the-art in camera-agnostic monocular 3D reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Recent work in additive manufacturing and neural inverse design enables the creation of complex three-dimensional structures to manipulate physical fields, yet these designs must also adhere to discrete, non-differentiable fabrication constraints. Current methods limit the design space by imposing differentiable soft manufacturability loss penalties, or by fixing structures through post-processing, causing a discrepancy between the geometry optimized by the physics model and the final fabricated result. Thus, we present AcoustiPrint, a physics-informed neural architecture for constrained inverse design that represents three-dimensional geometries with an implicit neural representation (INR) and passes each candidate through a printability operator before evaluating its final response. The printability operator executes layer-wise self-support, discrete material selection, and whole-body connectivity, assuring fabrication feasibility. To allow for backpropagation through the discrete non-differentiable operations, we use surrogate gradients for the backward pass and a self-supervised printability objective that progressively drives the INR toward a valid design domain. We demonstrate AcoustiPrint for personalized transcranial focused ultrasound, where inter-patient differences in acoustic properties and head geometry deform wave propagation and requires patient-specific acoustic focusing. AcoustiPrint jointly optimizes three-dimensional geometry and material composition through differentiable wave physics while ensuring manufacturability. Experiments show manufacturable acoustic structures with enhanced focal accuracy and over density-based and phase-based baselines, demonstrating a generalized methodology for neural design through non-differentiable manufacturing constraints and differentiable physics.",

As these skill libraries grow, they accumulate duplicated, mislabeled, and defective skills. The signals normally used to curate them (a skill's name, description, or source code) say little about how the skill visually changes the image. We present VisCurate, a framework and benchmark that curates visual skill libraries from observed execution rather than from text. VisCurate runs each candidate skill pair on a shared probe battery and assigns one of six behavioral relations, each tied to a library edit that is safe to make. The benchmark injects seven defect types into a clean library at controlled rates, producing 300 reproducible instances with ground-truth relations and repairs. While text baselines accept up to five of six false merges on hard negatives, our verifier accepts none and recovers 51.2% of the pairs that are truly mergeable. On two real, uncurated libraries, VisCurate finds that 92% of the skills a package shares with its downstream copy are redundant, while execution confirms only 10 of 17 published equivalence claims. The curation problem also remains open, as the strongest of the nine automated curators recovers only about half of the repairs.

We attack this failure by injecting a soft ontology prior over the latent concepts into the training objective and compiling it together with the task constraint into a smooth, decomposable probabilistic circuit. Under independent Bernoulli perception, the normalisers of the resulting structured concept posterior reduce to weighted model counts that are linear in the compiled circuit size, because the neural leaf weights fold into the circuit before evaluation. The soft compilation strategy places expert axioms in the circuit's weights rather than its support (task-structural axioms guaranteed by the data-generating process stay hard), so noisy expert axioms only redistribute prior mass and cannot empty the support. We characterise how the prior reweights label-restricted shortcut mass through differences in ontology violation energy, show that soft priors incur bounded log-density perturbations under bounded axiom noise, and prove that the hard-support counterpart can be made degenerate by a single corrupted axiom. We validate these predictions on an audited six-concept view of the real-world BDD-OIA driving benchmark and on controlled NeSy tasks.",

    "abstract": "Adding control to video generation often requires training, which demands additional computational resources, data, or architectural changes. We propose a training-free approach that utilizes pretrained video diffusion models to control object layout and motion using coarse layouts. Our method operates in two passes: first, it steers spatiotemporal placement through prompt-guided cross-attention to produce a coarse visual guide; second, this guide conditions the same model to generate a high-quality, layoutconsistent video. The approach enables coordinated motion with strong temporal consistency, supporting diverse trajectories and object interactions without additional training. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms prior work in overlap and trajectory accuracy, as well as visual quality across static, dynamic, and multi-object scene settings.",

    "abstract": "LLM agents are flexible in language interaction, but using them as long-horizon planners is costly and prone to hallucinated or invalid actions. This paper targets a different role for LLMs: constrained bridges between language and symbolic planning. We propose MemPlan, a memory-conditioned PDDL planning framework for partially observable interactive text environments. MemPlan keeps the PDDL domain fixed and reconstructs the PDDL problem at each step from parsed observations, candidate hypotheses, and interaction memory. Positive graph memory assigns relevance-based action costs to candidate hypotheses for missing objects, locations, or conditions, guiding the planner toward more plausible checks. Negative memory records execution-refuted assumptions and compiles them into exclusion constraints, preventing repeated attempts at candidates already contradicted by feedback. A unified schema-conditioned language--symbol interface, trained offline with supervised fine-tuning, connects text environments to the planning loop through observation-to-fact parsing and symbolic-action-to-command grounding. Experiments on TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Robotouille show that MemPlan improves task completion and step efficiency over language-only and PDDL-aware baselines, while substantially reducing online token cost compared with LLM-planning baselines such as ReAct. The same fine-tuned interface is also reused across TextWorld task types without task-specific fine-tuning. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/tewiSong/MemPlan.",

    "abstract": "Web-searching Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed how users seek online information: instead of sifting through ranked lists of links, users read synthesized answers. This shift creates a new LLM vulnerability: a data-void exploit. Disinformers publish their narratives in search spaces where relevant and reliable content is scarce, i.e. data voids, then rely on the LLM's web-search to retrieve and then use, cite, or list those pages in its responses to data-void seeking prompts. Unlike classical search, where users see ranking cues and competing results, LLMs can obscure when an answer relies on sparse, unverified, or adversarial sources. We study this threat by varying the user's prompt tone - skeptical, excited, or neutral - and LLM choice - ChatGPT, Gemini, or Sonar Pro - as well as three attacker controls. The attacker can use one of five known strategies to construct and fill a data void with their narrative, host their content at varying levels of visibility from well-established, indexed domains to less established ones, and include generative-optimization engine features thought to boost citing by web-searching LLMs. We find that data-void exploits can succeed with only a single attacker controlled page. Across all conditions, attacker-content appears in LLM responses 31% of the time. User controls offer limited protection: while skeptical prompts slightly reduce success and slightly increase flagging or warnings in LLM responses, we find no evidence of large effects of prompt tone or model choice on success rates, although smaller effects cannot be ruled out. Overall, our results establish data voids as a practical inference-time attack surface for manipulating web-searching LLMs through strategically placed web content and highlight the urgent need for defenses against such exploits.",

    "abstract": "Activation probes are computed directions in a language model's residual stream, used both to detect safety-relevant behaviours and, by adding their direction back into the stream, to steer them. We explore how the main design choices behind such probes interact, within one pipeline, on one model (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), and across three behaviours: deception, high-stakes awareness and sycophancy. The pipeline crosses two estimators (difference-of-means and logistic regression) with three token-pooling schemes (last, mean and learned attention), selects appropriate layers to detect or steer a behaviour, and evaluates every direction twice: as a detector of the behaviour, and as a steering vector to push outputs towards the behaviour. Prior work read together suggests a read/write dissociation, in which logistic regression reads (detects) best but difference-of-means directions write (steer) best. We find that it holds for deception and high-stakes but not for sycophancy, where the pattern reverses. The reversal appears to follow partially from the data rather than from the estimators. The best pooling technique and the layer choice depend on the behaviour and data, and the layer that steers best can sit well before the layer that detects best. The right steering metric to use between changing a model's perception and eliciting behaviour depends on the task - and the two can disagree outright. The exported probes and directions power an interactive interface through which a user can score and steer text directly.",

This mismatch becomes increasingly problematic in social virtual reality (VR), where features designed for typical social activities (e.g., virtual locomotion, spatial and social context) can become meaningful levers for shaping the user experience. To address our limited understanding of these effects, we conducted three exploratory experiments (N$_1$=109, N$_2$=116, N$_3$=88) examining how spatial boundary type, size of allocated personal space, and group familiarity influence co-watching 360-degree stories in social VR. Results shows that small communal spatial boundaries heightened social presence towards others compared to individual boundaries, but also increased mental demand. Reducing the size of the personal spatial boundary increased social presence towards others but also increased disorientation and frustration. Finally, participants with higher group familiarity reported stronger attentional focus on the story, as well as higher spatial presence and social presence towards story characters, but also reported greater physical and perceptual demand. We discuss systematic tradeoffs between engagement and cognitive effort, and suggest practical guidelines for designing shared immersive narrative experiences.",

Our approach decouples reasoning effort allocation from answer generation by introducing a routing policy that allocates a fixed sampling budget across multiple reasoning formats, while the base model is optimized with GRPO using per-sample rewards. To promote efficient reasoning, we employ a rank-based reward that favors shorter correct solutions, and update the routing policy via a closed-form KL-regularized policy improvement step distilled into a neural router. This design encourages concise answers on easy problems while reserving longer reasoning for harder ones, achieving improved accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across multiple reasoning benchmarks.",

We train a reinforcement learning policy initialized from a state-of-the-art language model in a self-judged tournament with masked thinking: the generated arguments are judged pairwise on argument quality by the policy itself. As an empirical basis, we extract authentic dilemmas from classic novels, using a logic solver to verify that each constitutes a conflict. We show that our judge rates argument quality like human annotators, and the policy then adopts the language register that it rewards. Testing on the external benchmarks MoralChoice, ELEPHANT, and MORABLES, we find that the policy becomes more decisive and invariant to the order in which options are presented, but sycophancy and reframing remain a challenge to validity. Two ablation studies with synthetic dilemmas and unmasked thinking match the reordering gains, but show a weaker register shift and higher sycophancy. We conclude that consistency is not validity: consistency under reordering can be optimized without improving the moral judgment it is meant to signal.",

A secret key conditions a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) mechanism that transforms the internal representation of the watermark signal before embedding, thereby coupling the payload to the key at the feature, rather than pixel level. The same key must be presented to condition the decoder to correctly recover the payload embedded in an image. To enforce conditional access, we train the system to maximize the performance gap between authorized and unauthorized use, ensuring reliable extraction under the correct key while inducing failure under incorrect keys. In addition, we design our encoder to estimate the watermark residual invariant to the presence of pre-existing watermarks. This design enables conditional watermark removal via simple re-encoding and subtraction of the residual using iterative refinement, contingent on knowledge of the secret key. We evaluate FiLM-CAM across multiple watermarking encoder-decoder backbones, demonstrating that keyed feature modulation serves as an effective, architecture-agnostic conditional access module (CAM) for image watermarking.",

    "abstract": "As quantum computing moves from the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era toward early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC), quantum-enhanced AI is shifting from a conceptual idea to experimental research. Quantum components are expected to extend the capabilities of existing AI systems, yet it remains unclear how such components will help within large multimodal models. In this study, we try to answer that question for vision-language models (VLMs) using classically simulated quantum layers. With LLaVA-OneVision as the backbone, we evaluate 4- and 8-qubit basic-ring and strongly entangling circuits at four insertion and four replacement locations. Insertion adds quantum layers to the classical model, while replacement substitutes them for classical components. Using the same setup, we compare performance and computational cost between classical and quantum-classical hybrid models. On the Visual Spatial Reasoning dataset, inserting a quantum layer after the visual projector reaches 80.7% development accuracy, 2.28 percentage-points above classical full fine-tuning. Replacing the final decoder feed-forward sublayer retains 79.22% accuracy with 13.07 million fewer trainable parameters. Quantum insertion can thus improve accuracy, and selective replacement can reduce parameters. These benefits depend strongly on where the quantum layer is inserted or which classical component it replaces: earlier replacements lower accuracy, and fewer parameters do not reliably shorten training or reduce computation. To assess potential security benefits, we evaluated the robustness of quantum-classical hybrid models under six attack settings. Overall, our study maps where quantum layers help and hurt within VLMs, offering a starting point for hybrid VLM design; whether these gains generalize remains open.

Unlike existing open-loop trackers, RoPT delivers three critical capabilities that fundamentally alter system resilience. First, the visual perception component tracks object masks to robustly handle partial and severe occlusions. Second, a kinematic factor graph regularizes frame-to-frame updates, forecasts forward pose predictions, and drives a parallel multi-hypothesis verification scheme to bypass local minima. Finally, an active re-localization module transforms the pipeline into a closed-loop system, making it failure-aware and capable of deterministic self-recovery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across challenging benchmarks alongside real-world robotic demonstrations, achieving significantly higher tracking survivability under rapid motion.",

Classical planners search over explicit symbolic task representations and can provide formal guarantees with respect to encoded safety constraints, but require rigid input formats. Their computational cost also increases rapidly with the search space. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) offer flexible task interfaces and strong generalization capabilities, but they are large, power-hungry, and pre-trained with little robot-specific safety data and knowledge. Thus, they can be difficult to deploy locally on robotic systems with limited resources. To address these limitations, we present SLoSa, a neuro-symbolic compression and fine-tuning framework for training foundation-model-based robotic task planners with Small size, Low power demand, and Safety awareness. The framework first constructs a safety-aware dataset using classical planners, an advanced teacher LLM, and formal verifiers, followed by two training stages: supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by a verification-based reward machine to enforce safety alignment. We evaluate SLoSa across four Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domains, two household simulation environments, local edge platforms, and a desktop robotic arm. Across the PDDL tasks, verifier-guided post-training raises the success rate of compact 4B-14B planners to 70.5-76.0%, while INT4 deployment on a Jetson Orin requires 17.85-26.41 W of average power.

We exploit a simple asymmetry: paired videos are hard to obtain, but paired real-to-coarse images are easy to construct with existing editing and 3D reconstruction tools. Using these image pairs, we train the DINO-R2C model to transfer realistic images to coarse images in DINO feature space, and apply it frame-wise to ordinary real videos to synthesize pseudo-coarse videos. The C2R# model then learns to generate each real video from its pseudo-coarse counterpart, free from needing (coarse, realistic) video pairs. At inference, the DINO-R2C model is discarded and actual coarse videos drive the C2R# model directly. Thus, our pair-free training scales with any real-video corpora rather than with paired synthetic videos.

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly expected to interact with environments and improve their decisions during deployment. However, how anticipating future outcomes and drawing on accumulated interaction experience can jointly support decision-making remains underexplored. We propose a test-time framework, inspired by Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, that combines multi-branch predictive analysis with experience-based adaptation. At each step, the agent proposes multiple candidate actions and imagines their outcomes with a world model, so that alternatives can be compared without being executed in the environment. Since language environments provide neither explicit dynamics nor costs, the predicted outcomes are evaluated for task progress and risk, and MPPI-style weights over the resulting costs guide the final decision. A dual-branch experience memory enables self-improvement: the planner branch refines candidate generation and action selection, while the world model branch improves next-observation prediction. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld across three backbones demonstrate the strong overall performance of our method and the effectiveness of experience-guided predictive control. Our code will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Voice style conversion (VSC) aims to transform a source utterance to match the timbre, accent, and emotion of a target voice while preserving linguistic content. StyleStream 1.0 introduced the first streamable zero-shot VSC system with state-of-the-art conversion quality, but remained limited in two ways: approximately 1s end-to-end latency on consumer hardware, and the lack of a text-based interface for designing or editing target voices. We present StyleStream 2.0, a fast and controllable streaming VSC framework that addresses these limitations. To reduce latency, we train a few-step pixel MeanFlow model and further fine-tune it with autoregressive feedback inspired by Self Forcing, improving robustness under streaming inference. This reduces end-to-end latency to 520~ms on a consumer GPU, a 2x speedup over StyleStream 1.0, while maintaining conversion quality. To enable controllable style manipulation, we remove the mel-spectrogram context and instead route target style information through a compact style embedding. In this embedding space, we train a unified text-conditioned flow matching model that supports both text-based voice design, which maps natural language prompts to voice styles, and instruction-based voice editing, which modifies a specific attribute of a source utterance while preserving the rest. Experiments show that StyleStream 2.0 achieves the strongest target style fidelity on VSC, voice design, and voice editing, while remaining competitive on intelligibility and non-edited attribute preservation.",

    "abstract": "Coding agents now complete tasks autonomously, modifying real-world state such as artifacts, software environments, and configurations along the way. Yet they show limited backup awareness: recognizing that an action will modify state that may later be needed, and preserving it beforehand. To evaluate backup awareness, we introduce RegretBench, a benchmark of 205 executable tasks grounded in regret moments reported on platforms such as X.com, GitHub, and Stack Overflow, where users explicitly regretted not preserving state they later needed. Across six frontier models, agents complete 86.1% of tasks on average yet back up before these moments in only 15.2%, showing that task completion ability does not imply backup awareness. Because it is hard to predict which changes will be regretted, we propose BackUpper, a harness plug-in backup layer that checks every tool call and preserves affected state before modification. It combines rule-based strategies for common operations with a lightweight subagent for complex cases, and its rule table can expand with subagent decisions over time. On RegretBench, BackUpper covers every regret moment action and restores states with 92.2% average similarity to the original. Achieving this costs only $0.014 per task, with 7x fewer tokens than the main-agent self-backup baseline. When users have preferences on what to back up, BackUpper can also narrow its scope accordingly, matching human annotations on whether an action is worth preserving with an 84.5% F1 score. These results suggest that agents can keep actions reversible at low cost while respecting users' preferences.",

    "abstract": "Frontier language-model agents excel at complex tasks, but high inference costs make transferring their capabilities to smaller models essential. Traditional knowledge distillation achieves this through parameter updates, requiring access to the student's weights and additional training compute while encoding the transferred knowledge implicitly in the parameters. We introduce D-Skill, a framework that treats the teacher as a black box and distills its behavioral advantage into an interpretable natural-language skill by analyzing paired rollouts and identifying behavioral divergences and agreements. The resulting lessons are consolidated offline, with any compatible skill-update backend, into a skill document that is provided to the student at inference time. D-Skill constructs the skill entirely offline from fixed trajectories, without labels, further environment interaction, or weight updates after rollout collection. Across SpreadsheetBench-Verified, ALFWorld, and chess puzzles spanning multiple teacher-student pairs, D-Skill closes 75%-95% of the teacher-student gap without touching model weights. After a single offline pass over the paired traces, D-Skill outperforms one-epoch SFT baselines and remains competitive with multi-epoch SFT. Under the same model family, the resulting student also incurs 5.7x-8.3x lower inference cost per task than the teacher. Our results demonstrate that natural-language skill distillation offers a performant, interpretable, and efficient alternative to weight-based capability transfer.",

    "abstract": "Large language models are expected to estimate their own uncertainty, with confidence signals used to guide retrieval, adaptive compute allocation, routing, and selective abstention. We investigate whether confidence signals measured at different temporal stages of problem solving encode distinct forms of epistemic information and remain reliable beyond English-centric settings. Inspired by classical meta-memory theory, we distinguish anticipatory pre-solve confidence (Feeling-of-Knowing, FOK) from retrospective post-solve confidence (Judgement-of-Learning, JOL). We evaluate these signals across two frontier LLMs, multiple reasoning domains, translated Marathi benchmarks, and a newly constructed benchmark of genuinely local Marathi factual questions. Across settings, the cheaper pre-solve signal remains weakly calibrated, while post-solve confidence generally provides stronger epistemic alignment despite its additional inference cost. Confidence behaviour transfers surprisingly well under direct language translation, with calibration trends largely preserved between English and Marathi, but degrades substantially on local Marathi knowledge, suggesting that linguistic transfer alone is insufficient for region-specific information needs. Finally, hallucinated responses maintain persistently elevated confidence after answer generation, highlighting important limitations of current LLM self-assessment mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models transfer knowledge from large-scale pretraining into robot control, but their manipulation performance remains sensitive to changes in observation conditions, which recent work addresses by fine-tuning the visual module on target-domain data. However, it remains unclear how such adaptation affects robustness beyond the target condition, as existing robustness benchmarks only evaluate models without fine-tuning and adaptation studies only report the target gain. Measuring this cross-dimension effect requires separating target gains from off-target changes, isolating adaptation effects from architectural differences, ruling out generic forgetting, and comparing tuning choices. Therefore, we introduce VLA-Retain, a benchmark that compares five open VLA models, tuned on Camera-view or Sensor-noise data, with their own base checkpoints on LIBERO-Plus dataset spanning seven perturbation dimensions. Our study reveals four findings. First, targeted vision tuning is not local, and its target gain does not predict retention. Mean off-target gain is negative in 8 of 10 model--domain configurations. Under Camera-view tuning, X-VLA gains $69.4$ percentage points on the target but loses $4.6$ points on average elsewhere, whereas OpenVLA-OFT gains $39.3$ and $1.4$ points, respectively. Second, these regressions are not explained only by performance loss on the same tasks without perturbations. Third, broader training coverage raises overall gain over target-specific training but does not eliminate dimension-level regressions. Fourth, tuning strategies are model-dependent, as DELTA-style feature preservation raises X-VLA's mean off-target gain to $+1.2$ points but lowers OpenVLA-OFT's to $-23.1$. Overall, these findings show that target-domain success alone is insufficient and highlight cross-dimensional retention as a key criterion for targeted VLA adaptation.",

Building such structured maps requires a scene representation that consistently distinguishes semantic regions and object instances across viewpoints. To this end, we present PanoGraphGS, a unified framework that integrates panoptic 3D Gaussian representation learning with hierarchical 3D scene graph construction. The framework learns semantic and instance features on shared Gaussian geometry. Prototype-based semantic learning and association-based instance learning produce consistent panoptic predictions across viewpoints. The learned representation supports novel-view panoptic segmentation and direct Gaussian-level panoptic decoding. A semantic-aware scene graph module further recovers a floor-room-stuff-object hierarchy with containment and spatial relations. We further release NaviGS, a real-world dataset for panoramic scene understanding. The dataset provides 3DGS, mesh, RGB, semantic, and depth data. For 3D scene graph identification, PanoGraphGS outperforms the strongest evaluated baseline in object-node accuracy by more than 50\\% points on average across Replica and NaviGS. PanoGraphGS also achieves state-of-the-art performance among the evaluated methods in 2D panoptic segmentation.

    ],
    "abstract": "Long-video understanding with multimodal LLMs is fundamentally constrained by the mismatch between video length and the model's limited visual context budget, making frame selection essential for practical reasoning. Existing query-aware methods typically rely on heuristic pipelines: they assign one-dimensional query-conditioned scores to frames and then apply sampling, ranking, or extraction rules to form the final subset. While effective in practice, such methods are generally not derived from an explicit optimization objective and struggle to capture the heterogeneous evidence required for complex reasoning. In this paper, we revisit long-video frame selection from a principled optimization perspective. We formulate it as a structured evidence-allocation problem and propose OTFS, an optimal transport framework that maps multiple evidence sources onto video frames. To reflect the asymmetry of this problem---important evidence should be preserved, whereas redundant frames need not absorb mass---we instantiate this view with a semi-unbalanced entropic optimal transport objective and an efficient solver, OTFS-Sinkhorn. Combined with an exact dynamic program for coverage-aware subset extraction, OTFS yields a practical two-stage training-free pipeline. We further show that, in the single-source case, our formulation induces a Gibbs-type distribution over frames, making Q-Frame's temperature-scaled distribution a special case of our framework while also providing a broader perspective for understanding related prior methods. Experiments on three long-video understanding benchmarks show that OTFS consistently outperforms strong training-free baselines. Codes are available at https://github.com/barry664/OTFS.",

    "abstract": "Modern industrial ranking systems increasingly adopt generative recommendation (GR) paradigms, in which user behavior sequences and non-sequential (NS) features are tokenized and jointly modeled by Transformer-style backbones. This unified formulation provides a scalable interface for modeling long histories and heterogeneous features. However, sequence and NS representations often carry asymmetric semantics: historical representations may combine environment context with observed-action semantics, whereas candidate-side NS representations contain no observed action but incorporate richer supplementary context, such as user-item interaction features and recent behavior lists. Direct interaction between such representations can make query-key dot products compare different semantic objects, limiting meaningful cross-token interaction. To fill this gap, we propose EASformer, an Environment-Action-State disentangled architecture for industrial app ranking. EASformer constructs an explicitly aligned context environment space shared by historical and non-sequence tokens, while disentangling user actions from historical token and candidate-specific context form non-sequence tokens. Based on this aligned space, EASformer enables complementary historical action retrieval and state-conditioned action prediction. Furthermore, the disentangled design supports a Cloze-style self-supervised objective by masking historical actions and reusing the candidate prediction pathway. On an offline benchmark from a real-world industrial app marketplace, EASformer achieves an AUC of 0.89411, yielding a 0.88% relative improvement over the deployed baseline. Online A/B tests further support this advantage, with relative eCPM lifts of 1.26% and 3.94% across two real-world ranking scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare providers lose substantial revenue to systematic payer underpayments and claim denials, yet identifying the recurring, correctable patterns behind them remains largely manual and does not scale to hospital claim volumes. We present Pattern Intelligence, a deployed system that discovers such patterns without supervision by clustering claims on their adjudication behaviour rather than their identity. Each claim is embedded in a 130-dimensional vector combining per-line expected-versus-actual payment ratios, claim adjustment reason (CARC) codes, denial and payment signals, and service composition. Payer and contract identity are deliberately excluded from the distance metric - we show they dominate the geometry and collapse clusters into trivial per-payer groups - and are reintroduced only as a post-hoc segmentation (by contract and visit type) that keeps every surfaced pattern coherent and actionable. We cluster with HDBSCAN, recover structure from the noise set via second-pass sub-clustering, and gate low-confidence memberships. A large language model translates each centroid into an analyst-ready description of dominant procedures, adjustment reasons, and failure mode. We report a recurring finding: roughly one-third to one-half of high-dollar denials, depending on tenant and segmentation, form an irreducible long tail that no density-clustering configuration or representation we tried groups - a domain property, we argue, rather than a modeling deficiency. We evaluate validity through cluster-coherence analysis and quantify impact with a recoverable-opportunity ($) metric on two production tenants (approx. 10K and 157K claims) within a six-tenant deployment. Rather than a new algorithm, the contribution is a problem formulation, a representation-design insight, and empirical findings from production.",

    "abstract": "Electronic health records are written to support care, not retrieval. Across years of oncology notes, the primary diagnosis is restated in report after report, while the events that shape a patient's course, such as a recurrence or a change in therapy, may be recorded only once. A retriever that ranks passages by similarity to the query keeps returning the repeated material and can miss these transitions, that is, it exhibits temporal redundancy across historical narratives. We argue that longitudinal clinical retrieval should be treated as allocating a limited evidence budget across time, not just ranking by relevance. We separate the task into three objectives: temporal evidence allocation, candidate reconstruction, and clinical validation. In Study A (13 clinical queries over 20 patient records, with two-stage reconstruction), the Temporal-15 configuration reaches a milestone slot recall of 0.538, compared with 0.388 for the Global-50 baseline. However, it also retrieves far more evidence (496 versus 50 indexed units per query), so the gain cannot be credited to allocation alone. When evidence is held fixed, removing prompted precedence rules raises schema-order reversals from 0.010 to 0.080. A five-patient, single-query pilot with fixed budgets finds that wider temporal coverage does not reliably yield more dated milestones. Together, these results suggest that how much a record says about a period is a poor guide to how useful that period is as evidence. Because no expert reference timelines are available, our measurements describe retrieval behavior rather than clinical accuracy. This position and technical report presents the retrieval analysis behind the Onco-CONSTRUE framework and sets out a research agenda for budget-constrained longitudinal clinical retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Electromyography (EMG) provides a non-invasive means of decoding silently articulated speech into text, but accurate decoding remains challenging due to limited availability of paired EMG-text data. We introduce PhonoBridge, a two-stage framework comprising a channel-aware EMG-to-phoneme frontend and a large language model (LLM) backend for text reconstruction. The frontend is trained on paired EMG-text data that consists of channel-wise feature extraction, cross-channel fusion, and electrode embeddings. With phonemes as the intermediate representation, we expand the backend's training data by converting LibriSpeech transcripts into phoneme-text pairs without additional EMG recordings. To adapt the LLM to frontend noise, we introduce Error-Profile-Guided Augmentation (EPGA), which perturbs transcript-derived phoneme sequences according to error patterns estimated from frontend predictions, generating additional training pairs for the LLM. On the Open Vocabulary silent-speech dataset, PhonoBridge achieves 24.77% WER, outperforming the previously reported best of 28.27% on the same test split.",

    "abstract": "In object goal navigation (ObjectNav), an embodied agent must find a target object (e.g., \"find a bed\") in a previously unseen environment, relying on spatial commonsense such as object co-occurrence. Large Language Models (LLMs) encode this commonsense, but deploying them on robots exposes a trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency: cloud-based models incur latency and privacy risks, whereas small on-device LLMs are fast but prone to hallucinated spatial judgments. Hybrid reasoning LLMs offer both a fast non-thinking mode and a slow thinking mode, which raises a key question for embodied agents: when is slow thinking worth its cost? We propose CovNav, a training-free framework that answers this question with Conformal Prediction (CP), turning dual-process (System 1 / System 2) inference into an uncertainty-aware decision. Much like recent decision models such as Jev, CovNav casts each spatial query as a structured binary decision rather than free-form generation: a local LLM in fast mode judges whether the target is likely near an observed object, CP converts its token probabilities into a prediction set, and only ambiguous queries are escalated to slow chain-of-thought reasoning. The object-pair formulation keeps calibration tractable and supports open-set objects through off-the-shelf detectors. Experiments on Gibson and HM3D show that CovNav surpasses the strongest zero-shot baseline by 0.8 and 1.7 percentage points in success rate on HM3D v1 and v2, while invoking slow reasoning for only 12.4% of queries and retaining most of the gain of always-on thinking at a fraction of its latency. Real-robot experiments on a TurtleBot 4 further validate the approach. CovNav shows how calibrated uncertainty can decide when an embodied agent should think slowly, offering a principled form of adaptive test-time reasoning for LLM-based robots.",

    "abstract": "Rerunning every governance control after every change to an artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline is expensive, so teams reuse earlier results. Reuse is safe only if each control's declared dependencies cover everything that can change its outcome, and only if the release gate checks that reused evidence describes the candidate being released. This article makes both conditions explicit and measures how often the first fails in practice. It defines when a signed evidence record is valid for a candidate and gives sufficient conditions under which change-local re-execution reaches the same release decision as rerunning every control. A reference gate implementing these checks with Ed25519 digital signatures blocks eight of nine manipulation scenarios, against one for a gate that trusts the planner and three for a gate that only verifies signatures; a dependency the policy never declared passes every gate. A replay of 38,083 commits from 714 public Data Version Control (DVC) pipelines measures that failure mode. Reusing stage results according to declared dependencies avoids 83.4% of stage executions, but in 3.3% of commits it reuses a stage whose imported code or referenced configuration changed, and 31% of pipelines are affected. A manual audit confirms the undeclared dependency in 36 of 40 sampled events. Evaluation stages, whose outputs are the evidence, are the most exposed. Adding each stage's static import closure lowers stale reuse to 0.4% while still avoiding 81.6% of executions; sampled shadow re-execution removes far less, and rerunning everything after unexplained changes avoids only 45.3%.",

We study within-instance allocation: under a hard per-instance prompt-plus-completion token cap, when should inference stop, generate another candidate, or spend residual tokens adjudicating candidates already observed? BOSS is a training-free policy for this three-way decision, with worst-case budget checks before every generation and judge call. Its key contribution is online generation-adjudication allocation under one shared token ledger. Across two Llama-3.1 models and four reasoning benchmarks, BOSS attains the highest accuracy in 22 of 24 model-task-budget cells under the common hard cap. At Llama-3.1-8B and B=4k, it reaches 60.5 macro-average accuracy versus 58.6 for Adaptive-Consistency, 59.1 for TALE-EP, and 58.9 for fixed-schedule League. On identical Stage-I candidate pools, randomized A/B judging with repeated voting improves plurality from 58.4 to 60.3, with the full BOSS selector reaching 60.5. Approximately matched-cost controls further characterize how the benefit of adjudication changes with available inference budget. Together, these results establish generation-adjudication allocation as a distinct design axis for reasoning under strict per-instance caps.",

    "abstract": "Integrated Remote Operation Centres (IROCs) are emerging as the architectural frontier of Industry 4.0 for capital-intensive sectors such as mining, oil and gas, and energy. Yet two intertwined gaps constrain their evolution towards full autonomy. First, no integrated agentic architecture has been proposed for mining IROCs that orchestrates Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems, digital twins, predictive analytics and human-machine interfaces under safety-critical constraints. Second, no evaluation framework jointly addresses the real-time, Health-Safety-Environment, regulatory-auditability and cost-per-decision requirements that govern industrial agentic deployments. This paper makes four contributions. It synthesises industry needs and quantified gains documented in analogous industries that motivate an agentic approach to mining IROCs. It introduces EI2ROC, a three-tier multi-agent architecture combining a Large Language Model orchestrator with specialised monitoring and production-capacityprediction agents communicating through a Model Context Protocol-style tool interface. It provides a critical review of agentic evaluation along six orthogonal dimensions and identifies the industrial blind spot of current benchmarks. Finally, it proposes a multi-dimensional benchmarking framework for industrial agentic AI comprising scenario library, harness, metrics and humancalibration protocol. The paper states explicitly which components are implemented in the current prototype, which belong to the proposed reference design and which remain future work, and reports preliminary cost and latency observations from an operating site. Together, EI2ROC and the benchmarking framework constitute a methodological blueprint transferable across CAPEX intensive industries.",

We propose a Human Turn-level framework for measuring human contributions, using task quality and token usage to characterize the collaborative production outcomes associated with each human instruction. We compare continuations from adjacent checkpoints under matched models, budgets, and termination conditions, and assess stability through repeated measurements. Across four archived and simulated interaction settings, we conduct 29,124 comparisons between predicted and observed directions of quality and computational change at both Human Turn and session levels. On HumanBench, we obtain 506 valid comparisons across 85 real-user scenarios. Results show that quality and computational changes associated with human guidance depend on task conditions. Expert-style and ordinary-style guidance differ in information provision, correction, and repetition. Even when task quality after continuation is identical, remaining computational demands can differ substantially across checkpoints. Our framework advances the measurement of human labor contributions from tasks and sessions to individual turns, providing a repeatable, fine-grained foundation for studying human contributions and their allocation in human-agent joint production.",

    "abstract": "Blurred vehicle contours and low contrast limit detection performance in infrared remote sensing imagery, while existing fusion methods may introduce polarization noise and fail to integrate complementary information effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a Mamba-based infrared polarimetric remote sensing image fusion model. Infrared polarization information reflects surface material properties and geometry, providing complementary information to infrared intensity. The proposed method first combines long-wave infrared total intensity S0 and the degree of linear polarization (DoLP), using a physics-inspired polarization-response proxy and spatial structural continuity to extract guidance features. It then employs bidirectional state space scanning along horizontal, vertical, and both diagonal orientations to enable cross-modal feature fusion across the entire image. Prior-guided multi-window structural similarity, reconstruction constraints, and a relative lower-bound loss for polarization saliency are jointly introduced to suppress noise while preserving global background structures and target polarization features. In addition, we construct AIR-LWIR-Pol, a dataset of 1,901 accurately registered image pairs acquired using an airborne division-of-aperture long-wave infrared polarimetric imaging system, and evaluate downstream vehicle detection using YOLO11. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the comparison methods on four fusion metrics, including entropy and structural similarity. Vehicle detection mAP50 and mAP50-95 reach 55.0% and 29.4%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining physical priors with state space modeling for long-wave infrared polarization image fusion and support its use for target detection in complex remote sensing scenes.",

In this system, the remote expert (with an exocentric view in Mixed Reality (MR)) uses a Tangible User Interface (TUI) to precisely position and rotate their avatar within a scaled tabletop World-in-Miniature (WIM). Inside the WIM, the expert's avatar and the operator share the same scale and egocentric view, while the expert retains a global tabletop overview of the plant to support collaboration. Interviews with industry experts during the participatory design phase revealed the need for an egocentric view inside the plant on the remote-expert side to enable full collaboration. We designed and studied three interaction-visualisation combinations to integrate and control the expert avatar's gaze: VR (fully immersive with direct head control), Head (floating screen with direct head control), and Touch (on-avatar screen with touchpad control). We evaluated these methods with 29 participants across two fault-detection tasks: Same Machine, where both collaborators inspect the same machine, and Twin Machine, where they inspect identical machines in separate locations. The VR condition, which combines immersion, direct head control, and a full-scale view, yielded the strongest overall performance and user experience, while the tabletop avatar setup was well received for collaboration. Our findings inform the design of gaze-control techniques for asymmetric MR-VR collaboration and reveal challenges and opportunities for future work.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal survival prediction jointly analyzes histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs), genomic profiles, and clinical variables to stratify patients by risk. However, existing approaches often inadequately account for granularity differences across modalities, particularly in spatial organization and feature dimensionality. Within pathology, aggregating WSI patch features without preserving their spatial arrangement can obscure tissue architecture; across modalities, directly concatenating low-dimensional clinical variables with high-dimensional visual and genomic features may limit the contribution of clinical information to prediction. To address these challenges, we propose HGASurv, which introduces a hierarchical WSI encoding module and a clinical-guided graph propagation module for granularity-aware multimodal integration. The hierarchical WSI encoding module maps WSI patch features onto a spatial grid using their original coordinates and applies parallel convolutions to construct representations at patch, local-neighborhood, and regional scales. Genomic signature embeddings then query these scale-specific WSI representations through cross-modal co-attention, producing signature-conditioned morphological features. The clinical-guided graph propagation module uses clinical variables to define patient-similarity edges and propagates fused image-genomic node embeddings with graph attention, integrating clinical information through topology rather than feature concatenation. Across three TCGA cohorts, HGASurv achieved the strongest overall C-index performance, with ablation studies supporting the complementary contributions of the hierarchical WSI encoding and clinical-guided graph propagation modules. This design shows that matching representation and integration mechanisms to modality-specific granularity improves multimodal survival prediction.",

While deep learning-based methods offer accelerated inference, existing studies predominantly treat contingency analysis as a pure regression problem, often overlooking the physical essence of grid operation and engineering requirements of real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a physics and prompt-guided graph foundation model (PhyPro-FM) for generalizable and engineering-viable contingency analysis. The proposed architecture integrates graph neural networks with a learnable global query mechanism and, notably, introduces a prompt-guided learning paradigm. By leveraging historical snapshots as few-shot prompts, the model dynamically captures correlations between target and historical operating conditions, significantly enhancing generalization capabilities under unseen topologies. Furthermore, we design a physics-informed training mechanism that prioritizes branch power flow errors over nodal voltage errors, aligning the optimization objective with critical grid security constraints. To ensure engineering applicability, a physics-informed inference mechanism is also developed, incorporating a residual-based correction module and a specialized post-processing strategy for singular branches to circumvent numerical instability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PhyPro-FM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalization, validating its superior physical consistency and robustness for practical engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Emergency vehicles such as police vehicles, fire engines, and ambulances require a stable and efficient route optimization to reach life-critical events in the shortest times possible. However, the dynamic nature of urban traffic makes this ideal scenario much more challenging, causing critical life-threatening delays. Traditional civilian navigation systems cannot account for real-time traffic changes alongside vehicle-specific constraints, creating inadequate routing scenarios. This research presents the Constraint-Aware Real-Time Routing System (CARRS), a unified software architecture tailored for emergency coordination. The CARRS architecture is engineered to fuse together classical pathfinding algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra, and Bidirectional A*, with Constraint Satisfaction Problem methodologies. The Design Science Research Methodology is the research framework, and prototyping is the iterative process. The artifact was empirically evaluated using OpenStreetMap data for major metropolitan road networks, combined with simulated dynamic traffic scenarios. Performance metrics focused on route optimality, constraint adherence, rerouting responsiveness, and the potential for future system scalability. Findings revealed the system's capability to generate optimal routes for operationally relevant subgraphs in under 35 seconds, with incremental rerouting responsiveness below 20 seconds. Furthermore, the system achieved more than 90% adherence to vehicle-specific constraints, making the CARRS architecture viable for real-time dynamic routing requirements. This study delivers a routing platform that bridges artificial intelligence-driven optimization with software engineering operational compliance, presenting a practical transformative step toward adaptive emergency vehicle coordination in dynamic urban environments.",

    "abstract": "Recursive self-improvement (RSI) requires agents to diagnose system bottlenecks and coordinate improvements across training and inference. We refer to the agents' capability to jointly optimize training data, the trainer, and the inference harness as cross-component co-design. We introduce VibeTraining-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating this capability across tasks spanning terminal operation, software engineering, multi-turn tool use, and mathematical reasoning. Within each task, research agents start from an identical initial agent system under a fixed resource budget. Guided by validation feedback, they iteratively refine data, trainers, and inference harnesses, then select and submit a final agent system for evaluation on the test set. To prevent reward hacking, we enforce three safeguards: test data isolation, separate research and grading containers, and network restrictions for research agents. Our evaluation results show that frontier research agents substantially improve target agent systems. For example, on SWE-bench Verified, GPT-6-Astra raises the target agent system's performance from 32.9% to 53.7%, comparable to the human-developed instruct model's 55.4%. However, there is still room to improve their ability to co-design and iteratively refine data, trainer, and harness to achieve cumulative performance gains. We hope that VibeTraining-Bench will serve as a unified platform for advancing RSI, deepening our understanding of cross-component optimization for agent systems.

    "abstract": "Earth observation satellites acquire more data than they can downlink. Extracting information on board with artificial intelligence (AI) turns the satellite into a data-reduction stage that downlinks compact products, such as masks or detections, instead of full scenes; deploying it in a mission, however, involves the whole processing chain and not only the neural network. We present a generic on-board AI processing chain along three axes, with wildfire segmentation as the worked example among ship detection and cloud segmentation. (i) The AI model is tuned (spectral-band selection, input normalization), quantized to 8-bit integers (int8) and ported to an AMD Versal VCK190, with its excellent segmentation performance preserved on the board. (ii) A modular tiler-inference-mosaicer workflow, reused unchanged across applications, brings the tile-level model to scene level, turning a full acquisition into a scene-level mask or detection list. (iii) Each step is packaged as a unikernel and orchestrated on board by ORCHIDE, a cloud-native orchestrator. The chain is characterized end to end, from the standalone execution on the target to its execution under orchestration with parallel workflows on a representative test bench. Beyond AI inference on individual tiles, this approach aims at increasing the maturity of on-board AI deployment by addressing a complete processing chain, from the acquired scene to the mission-level execution.",

    "abstract": "Lane departure and traffic-sign negligence are leading contributors to road accidents, particularly in regions with non-standardized signage and limited annotated data. Existing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) solutions are often developed as disjointed submodules, are rarely validated for real-time operation, and struggle to balance accuracy with low-latency inference for embedded deployment. We address these gaps with a unified, edge-deployable ADAS framework that simultaneously performs lane-departure warning (LDW) and traffic-sign detection and recognition (TSD/TSR), and validate the proposed system on automotive-class devices. Our framework combines a lightweight, lane-segmentation-driven LDW, which includes a drivable-area fallback for degraded markings, with a two-stage TSD/TSR pipeline consisting of efficient sign localization followed by fine-grained classification, designed to preserve accuracy at embedded latency. To support region-specific deployment under data scarcity, we curate a 35-class local traffic-sign dataset and introduce a generalized augmentation and balancing profile, expanding the corpus from 359 images to 8,750 samples. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, the integrated system sustains 15 FPS end to end (32 FPS for LDW and 18 FPS for TSD/TSR). The TSD/TSR branch achieves 97.4 mAP for detection and 95.6% validation accuracy (93.1% on a local real-world set) while maintaining an approximately 13.9 M parameter footprint. Relative to recent methods that target a single task or report results only on desktop-class GPUs, our approach delivers both LDW and TSD/TSR with real-time performance on edge hardware, providing a practical pathway to low-cost, field-ready ADAS in resource-constrained settings.",

We formulate longitudinal pCR prediction as a world-modeling problem and propose Conditioned Response-state World Modeling (CoRe-WM), which learns a latent state-transition model that predicts the next imaging state from the observed sequence. The transition function is conditioned on patient clinical profile and assigned therapy through additive shift and feature-wise modulation, enabling patient- and treatment-specific dynamics. A Factorized Response State pathway further decouples treatment-response dynamics from imaging appearance by encoding the structural prior that response manifests primarily in lesion morphology. After pretraining, all parameters are frozen and a linear readout predicts pCR at each clinical decision point. We evaluate CoRe-WM on I-SPY2 under five-fold cross-validation and assess cross-cohort transfer on I-SPY1. CoRe-WM achieves the highest discrimination among all evaluated methods at every prospective decision point, and demonstrates robust cross-cohort transfer. Ablation studies identify patient-profile conditioning and the factorized response pathway as the principal contributors. These results establish world-model-based representation learning as a promising framework for outcome prediction in oncology and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Polarization imaging provides informative cues for material analysis, scene understanding, and visual perception. However, acquiring complete polarization observations typically requires specialized hardware and multi-angle measurements, thereby increasing system complexity and limiting practical deployment. In this work, we address the problem of predicting the missing $45^\\circ$, $90^\\circ$, and $135^\\circ$ polarization views from a single $0^\\circ$ observation by leveraging a learned scene prior. To this end, we propose MPIG (Multi-angle Polarization Image Generation), a Swin Transformer-based framework that couples cross-angle feature interaction with residual decoding to predict angle-dependent intensity variations while preserving shared scene structure. Specifically, measured Stokes differences and polarization-strength-aware supervision guide the recovery of polarization modulation, orientation, and magnitude, while low-rank factorization further reduces the decoding cost. We also construct HighPol, a large-scale real-world polarization dataset comprising 5,474 groups of high-resolution four-angle polarization images collected from diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. Experimental results demonstrate improved image and polarization accuracy, achieving 29.729 dB PSNR, 0.9505 SSIM, and $21.514^\\circ$ AoLP MAngE while requiring 85.86 M parameters and 1.126 T FLOPs. Furthermore, downstream validation on glass and semantic-segmentation tasks suggests that the generated polarization images can preserve task-relevant information, demonstrating the effectiveness of MPIG and the practical utility of predicted polarization observations for downstream vision applications.",

This complicates reasoning for large language models (LLMs), which must retrieve evidence and resolve conflicts to determine which information remains valid. Existing evaluations treat information seeking as a black box, revealing little about where and why LLMs fail. To address this gap, we introduce TREK, a suite of three components: TREKTRACE is a plug-and-play framework that attributes failures to specific stages of retrieval and reasoning. We apply it to TREKBENCH-WILD, a meta-benchmark of real-world questions that require complex reasoning over rapidly evolving knowledge. Surprisingly, the main bottleneck is post-retrieval reasoning rather than retrieval: frontier models are often misled by conflicting evidence even after retrieving all the information needed to answer. To study this bottleneck, we build TREKBENCH-CTRL, a controlled benchmark with distractors spanning temporality, relevance, and trustworthiness, and show that benchmarks dominated by outdated distractors substantially underestimate task difficulty. Together, TREK provides a testbed for diagnosing and improving reasoning over rapidly evolving knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Attacks using ransomware have developed into complex multiphase campaigns that target vital infrastructure, resulting in annual damages of billions of dollars. Conventional detection techniques are ineffective against zero-day variations, and privacy issues are raised by centralized machine learning algorithms. Federated learning allows for cooperative model training without data sharing, however current FL approaches suffer from explainability issues, high communication cost, and non-IID data heterogeneity. In this study, we present AdaFedXplain, an explainable AI-based adaptive federated learning system for ransomware detection. Our approach includes progressive XGBoost complexity to avoid overfitting, a decaying learning rate schedule for stable convergence, and dynamic client grading based on ransomware prevalence and data sufficiency. Using 62,485 real-world ransomware samples from four OS-based non-IID clients, we compare AdaFedXplain against FedAvg, FedProx, and SCAFFOLD. According to experimental data, AdaFedXplain outperforms all baselines with 99.59% detection accuracy and 99.64% F1-score while cutting energy usage by 75%, latency by 65%, and communication overhead by 75%. The ablation investigation demonstrates that every element enhances performance. Security analysts can use SHAP explainability to identify important PE header characteristics that influence detection decisions. Our system provides a collaborative ransomware detection solution that is efficient and interpretable, while reducing privacy risks through federated learnings data-local training paradigm.",

An AI assistant should also be able to memorize and recall the nexus of events and spaces. Thus we introduce SENRI, a task that studies this space--event connection in long, continuous real-life egocentric video. It contains six task types in two directions: Event$\\rightarrow$Space, which recovers spatial knowledge from event cues, and Space$\\rightarrow$Event, which retrieves events from regions and trajectories. To evaluate this, we build SENRI-Bench, containing 500 manually annotated multiple-choice questions over 10 uninterrupted self-recorded videos with around 25.3 hours of content. Also, we evaluate three typical long video understanding paradigms: direct perception, evidence seeking, and persistent memory. The task remains challenging across all three paradigms, highlighting substantial room for improvement. Then we show two representative failure modes of existing memory methods and address these evidence gaps with SENRI-Agent, a controller that uses Target-Guided Visual Check (TGVC) to propose local visual check tasks for parallel verifiers and integrate the reports into a working memory to help with reasoning. Built upon existing memory systems, SENRI-Agent improves the performance of existing baselines without modifying their stored memories. We hope SENRI will provide valuable insights into how real-life egocentric understanding should be evaluated, reveal the gaps in existing approaches, and offer a possible direction for improvement.",

    "abstract": "Audio-visual deepfake detectors are often trained under a single dataset or manipulation regime, but multi-source training collections may contain heterogeneous attacks and uneven source distributions. Training separate detectors for each source is inefficient, while a single shared detector may be biased toward dominant source-specific patterns. We study known-source imbalanced multi-source audio-visual deepfake detection using FakeAVCeleb and LAV-DF, where source identity is supplied during training and inference. To address this setting, we build on the Multi-Scale Cross-Modal Transformer Encoder (MSCT) and propose Pre-MSCT Shared-Private Feature Fusion. Our method routes \\texttt{[CLS]}-augmented audio and visual tokens into a shared stream and source-specific private streams before the first MSCT block, while retaining its internal multi-scale self-attention (MSSA), differential cross-modal attention (DCA), and feed-forward operations. The shared stream models cross-source reusable evidence, while the private streams retain source-dependent residual variations. A domain-aware gated residual fusion module injects selected private evidence into the shared representation for the main fused prediction. Experiments under two controlled source-composition protocols show improved macro and worst-source AUC compared with the MRDF and MSCT baselines. These results support shared-private cross-modal discrepancy learning in the evaluated two-source setting with known source identity.",

In this paper, we study this phenomenon in Transformer planning. To analyze the inner mechanism, we follow the approach of Wang et al. (2024) and abstract planning as path-finding in graphs. In this setting, we train the model to detect the error of invalid transitions, i.e., after the model generates a next node that is not adjacent with the current node, the model should then generate a special abort token x. For expressiveness, we construct a Transformer with feed-forward width $O(|V|)$ for any fixed graph with node set $V$. It can detect all possible invalid transitions, and select a valid next node if the prefix is valid. We then propose a worst-case lower bound on feed-forward width, which makes the detector's linear width near-optimal up to logarithmic factors. In trained models, we demonstrate that invalid-transition detection increases previous-node attention, and most of the valid--invalid separation locates in the feed-forward network's output. This accords with our theoretical insights. Finally, we use this error detection to improve the model's performance: at inference, generating the abort token x will directly cause an external procedure to discard the attempt and restart from the original prompt. Experiments show that error detection combined with retry improves model's planning reliability on graphs, Countdown, and mazes.",

This asymmetry is not neutral: when a model answers questions about territory, community authority, or the relationship with nature, it does so from assumptions that may be alien to the communities using the system. This paper presents a system for aligning language models with the ethical principles of Indigenous communities in Latin America. Drawing on interviews with five Indigenous leaders and defenders, we built an operational cultural constitution grounded in an Indigenous cosmovision, with 12 principles. On this basis, we implemented a Constitutional AI (CAI) pipeline in two phases: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). The base models were Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. With only 24 preference pairs, improvements were modest but detectable in intergenerational transmission, linguistic caution, and consultation and consent. Qualitative analysis reveals that the SFT phase was responsible for the primary shift in alignment, while DPO refined specific categories. The system was deployed in a conversational interface with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that allows communities to feed the knowledge base, turning alignment into a participatory cycle. We argue the architecture is functional and will scale qualitatively once the corpus is expanded and computing constraints are resolved. The work constitutes a first iteration of an epistemic justice mechanism for value alignment in the Global South.",

To this end, we envision a four-stage research agenda, involving Ground, Structure, Verify, and Act, to guide this shift toward actionable latent-world understanding. Within our framework, existing JEPA interpretability efforts provide early evidence for Ground, while systematic analysis of latent structure, causal verification, and intervention remains largely unexplored.

In this work, we propose MotionShift, a novel motion transfer framework that achieves high-fidelity motion transfer while ensuring physical compatibility with the target scene. In particular, we design a planner--evaluator iterative motion adaptation mechanism, in which a Large Language Model (LLM) acts as the planner to generate motion trajectories by leveraging its strong semantic reasoning capabilities, while a Vision-Language Model (VLM) serves as the evaluator to rectify the motion based on its superior visual perception and scene understanding. Through this planner--evaluator synergistic reasoning process, the motion is adapted to the target scene in a training-free manner. The adapted motion is then used as a generative condition for an image-to-video (I2V) model to render videos in the target scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionShift achieves high-fidelity and physically compatible motion transfer across diverse and complex scenes. Moreover, we show that MotionShift can be readily integrated into existing trajectory-conditioned I2V models, endowing them with realistic motion transfer capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Transformers are widely assumed to exhibit token-decoding explainability. In particular, in vision transformer (ViT) classifiers, decoding individual patch tokens has become a common diagnostic tool due to its tendency to yield human-interpretable outputs. In light of the increasing popularity of this approach, an important question is whether token-decoding explainability is an inherent property of transformers that should be expected to hold across architectures, scales, and training objectives, or merely an artifact of some implicit bias. In this paper we systematically study token-decoding explainability across diverse ViT settings, spanning architectures, scales, and training objectives, using both controlled experiments and real-world models. We find that while some models indeed exhibit aligned and interpretable token decodings, others exhibit either inverted explainability maps or a complete lack of correlation with the image semantics. As we show, these tendencies toward different explainability behaviors are not intrinsic to the architecture and can vary arbitrarily with changes in the optimization landscape. We provide theoretical support for these observations by demonstrating a setting where a single fixed toy transformer architecture can provably implement the optimal classification rule in multiple ways, which differ in their patch-decoding explainability patterns. Our results show that token-decoding explainability is not an inherent property of trained transformers, but rather an outcome contingent on the problem setting and thus should not be a-priori assumed to hold.

Existing model-based methods lack explicit magnitude-invariant mechanisms, and learning-based methods require layout-specific training or per-image tuning, limiting generalization. To address these issues, we propose S3D-Mosaic, a model-based spectral demosaicing method built upon a subgradient-guided cross-band structure transfer framework. We first establish a subgradient-guided regularization framework with a generalized cosine-similarity interpretation, providing a convex mechanism for magnitude-invariant information transfer. Then we design a compact Directional Sparse Equivariant Difference Convolution (DSE-DConv) for band-level extraction of orientation-selective, high-frequency structure features at low computational cost. Instantiating the framework with DSE-DConv on spectrally adjacent bands yields a cross-band self-structure similarity regularizer for spectral demosaicing, which we optimize via a dual-scan ADMM algorithm that decouples the bidirectional dependency while propagating magnitude-robust structural information across bands. With DSE-DConv's two parameters trained once via self-supervision, S3D-Mosaic outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on CAVE and NTIRE 2022, and generalizes robustly to varying MSFA layouts, pan-mosaic fusion, and real-world UAV data with fixed reconstruction hyperparameters.

    "abstract": "We introduce Long Listening Thoughts (LLT), a framework for constructing post-training datasets that improves audio reasoning by pairing deliberate perceptual grounding with explicit cognitive behaviors. On audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, large audio-language models (LALMs) are limited primarily by perceptual errors, yet existing post-training datasets rely on audio descriptions of limited diversity. Through a four-stage pipeline, LLT (1) builds multi-aspect dense audio descriptions spanning semantic, acoustic, and temporal information, (2) generates more challenging questions, (3) synthesizes incorrect reasoning traces, and (4) extends short reasoning traces into long ones via a thought-continuation strategy that elicits cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. Using LLT, we synthesize 1.6M reasoning traces and train Qwen2.5-Omni-7B with a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference optimization (DPO). This improves accuracy on MMAU Test-mini (71.5 to 78.2), MMAR (56.7 to 63.7), and MMSU (60.6 to 66.0).",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation depends heavily on real images with pixel-level annotations, making dense supervision a major obstacle to deployment in new domains. We study task-specific data-free semantic segmentation, where training uses generic pretrained generative priors but has access to no target-domain images, masks, or captions--only a predefined category set. We introduce Zero-Data Semantic Segmentation (ZeroDSS), a feedback-driven approach that treats synthetic supervision as an adaptively controllable training distribution rather than a direct surrogate for real data. ZeroDSS constructs a semantically structured prompt distribution through LLM-guided compositional generation and adaptive class rebalancing, then converts the prompts into image-mask pairs using diffusion attention. Its feedback-driven distribution refinement consists of a two-phase closed-loop training procedure with a single loop-back step. In Phase I, a segmenter is trained using confidence-weighted supervision and dual-scale consistency. In Phase II, model feedback is used to adaptively target underperforming categories and refine diffusion-derived masks using model predictions. After this refined initial training, a teacher-student framework is utilized in the final phase to iteratively improve the fused supervision and segmenter through exponential moving average (EMA) updates. Using synthetic training data only, ZeroDSS achieves 35.0% mIoU on MS COCO with DeepLabV3, and 66.3% and 63.5% mIoU on PASCAL VOC with DeepLabV3 and Mask2Former, respectively. These results show that explicitly constructing and iteratively refining the synthetic supervision distribution can substantially reduce the synthetic-to-real gap in dense prediction.",

    "abstract": "We present Spatons, a family of compositional, spatially localized neural operators for computationally efficient XR (extended reality) predistortion and distortion compensation. XR displays (AR, VR, and MR) suffer from spatial (e.g., geometric) and tonal (e.g., colour) distortions. Frames can be pre-distorted so that the projected image looks as intended. Distortions vary with manufacturing tolerances and projection systems, motivating programmable compensation. Untethered, battery-operated XR systems also require low energy and latency. A Spaton is a hybrid patch-to-pixel block combining tiny Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed-function interpolation. Using Spatons, we build programmable, computationally efficient pipelines for varied distortion scenarios. On the full spatiotonal Scenario 5, Sequential-5' matches CompenNet++ in SSIM (0.944 vs. 0.944) and closely matches its PSNR (27.5 vs. 27.7 dB), with substantially lower complexity. We demonstrate a flexible Spaton solution with 6 times fewer FLOPs and 106 times fewer parameters than CompenNet++, and 4-10 times fewer memory transfers than UNet++. We characterize software implementations and analytical hardware estimates, including optimizations across target XR platforms. The distortions considered are drawn mostly from see-through, near-eye displays, where the spatial light path governs local intensity and spectral response. This early systems-level exploration uses closed-form differentiable distortions and one real projector-camera capture set for training and evaluation, rather than through-the-optics measurements. Testing on a wider range of real XR devices remains future work. Chromatic dispersion (color fringes) remains the main artifact where Spatons trail monolithic baselines.",

    "abstract": "In multimodal learning, modality imbalance often lets one modality dominate optimization and keeps the model from fully exploiting cross-modal interactions. Balance-oriented methods such as the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR) perform well by alleviating this imbalance during training. These dynamic balancing methods, however, mainly adjust modality contributions and do not consider how imbalance affects the formation of synergistic information during fusion. Synergy is a major source of multimodal advantage, because it is predictive gain that cannot be recovered from unimodal evidence alone. We propose the Multimodal Synergistic Competition Regularizer (MSCR), a fusion method that jointly promotes balanced modality utilization and the discovery of synergistic information. MSCR has two complementary objectives. An anti-dominance objective suppresses excessive unimodal influence and leaves room for synergistic information, and a synergy objective encourages the fused predictor to outperform a non-synergistic unimodal reference. An adaptive gate further concentrates the regularization on samples that need stronger collaborative modeling. Experiments on five benchmarks show that MSCR consistently improves performance over MCR and strengthens synergistic capability. It raises conditional recovery, the accuracy of the fused prediction on samples that the unimodal predictors misclassify, as well as the share of the model's output that InterSHAP attributes to cross-modal interactions. Its gain in conditional recovery persists when the fusion module is Transformer-based. Code is available at https://github.com/chenxinyu991-collab/MSCR.",

We construct a directed candidate graph from 328,839 MIMIC-IV discharge summaries using LLM extraction and UMLS normalization, and evaluate three signals against SemMedDB: within-admission co-occurrence lift, cross-admission diagnosis-coding temporal precedence, and literature corroboration. Lift filters unsupported co-mentions and provides useful EHR support, but not causal proof. Coding order is a weak direction signal: among the 686 candidates where it commits, it reaches 54.2% agreement with SemMedDB, below the extractor's 69.4% on the same subset. Literature corroboration supplies independent direction evidence but covers only 30.4% of candidate relations. A MIMIC-III replication yields the same pattern: extractor direction remains stable (70.5%), whereas coding-order direction is near chance (50.9%). Thus, text-mined clinical causal candidate KGs are best treated as EHR-supported but direction-uncertain. In a leakage-controlled causal QA benchmark, lift-only retrieval achieves 35.7% accuracy; conservative causal demotion achieves 37.2% while reducing evidence-unsupported answers from 17.3% to 6.1% at fixed retrieval recall.

    "abstract": "Improving every agent in an LLM-based multi-agent system can be prohibitively costly, making it important to identify which agent should be prioritized to achieve the greatest system-level gain with limited resources. Failure attribution can inform this decision, but an agent's responsibility for failures does not directly reveal the system-level gains achievable by improving it. We therefore introduce IF-MAP, an influence-function-inspired method for identifying agents with high potential for system-level improvement. For each agent, IF-MAP measures end-to-end loss changes under controlled semantic prompt perturbations, fits a regularized local response model in a low-dimensional prompt-embedding subspace, and uses the estimated response norm as a priority score. This black-box procedure requires no access to model parameters or gradients and produces agent priorities that can guide subsequent improvement effort. We evaluate IF-MAP across six multi-agent workflows spanning code generation, question answering, and mathematical reasoning, using the same priorities for prompt optimization and model upgrades. Optimizing the selected agents' prompts achieves a macro-average gain of 3.81 percentage points, compared with 1.85 for uniform agent selection. Across five target models, upgrading the selected agents yields macro-average gains of 7.62-16.42 percentage points, compared with 3.81-8.62 for uniform agent selection. Despite its probing overhead, IF-MAP reduces Qwen3-8B and DeepSeek-V3.2 token use by 74.2% and 35.2%, respectively, relative to optimizing every agent, and reduces target-model tokens by 63.6-64.9% relative to upgrading every agent.

Explanation-guided learning can address this problem, but multi-label classification introduces a key challenge: multiple abnormalities may coexist in an image, requiring each prediction to align with its corresponding spatial evidence. We propose a class-conditioned explanation-guided learning framework that constructs a separate explanation for each positive class and penalizes evidence outside its class-specific annotated regions. We instantiate the framework using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and evaluate it on 14 abnormalities using EfficientNet-B1, ViT-B/16, ViT-B/32, and Swin-B. Explanation guidance substantially improves annotation alignment across all architectures: All-Saliency Precision increases from 0.140 to 0.625, 0.052 to 0.551, 0.060 to 0.403, and 0.095 to 0.570, respectively. These improvements are accompanied by smaller, architecture-dependent changes in classification performance. Our results show that class-conditioned explanation guidance can substantially improve where multi-label classifiers concentrate their explanatory evidence while largely preserving predictive performance.",

However, collaborative MAS training is typically centralized, requiring a common trainer to aggregate role-local trajectories and learning signals and maintain model and optimization states. This motivates a distributed multi-agent learning paradigm in which agents improve system-level capabilities through role-local learning and decentralized communication, paving the way toward scalable, resilient, and self-organizing MAS. To this end, we introduce, to the best of our knowledge, the first optimization-grounded framework for distributed MAS training based on consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We formulate collaborative MAS learning as a consensus-constrained finite-sum optimization problem, naturally lending itself to distributed optimization via ADMM. The proposed approach alternates role-local learning with inter-agent consensus using distributed communication protocols such as ring all-reduce, enabling joint optimization while keeping each agent's data and training state local. We evaluate our framework on distributed safety alignment and general reasoning tasks. Under compromised-agent settings, ADMM can reduce HarmBench attack success rate (ASR) by up to 26.4%, while achieving reasoning gains comparable to centralized training. These results show that distributed MAS training retains the benefits of centralized joint optimization without requiring a centralized trainer.",

To address this issue, we reformulate IVIF as local Bayesian posterior rendering, where fusion is controlled by posterior action weights rather than direct modality mixing. In this paper, we propose Proposal-Context-Detail Fusion (PCDFusion), a visible-anchored framework that implements this formulation through three rendering stages. PCDFusion preserves potentially useful thermal responses, updates exposure-degraded visible regions, and renders reliable band-limited infrared structures into the final luminance.

    "abstract": "A 3D asset admits multiple valid part decompositions, while semantics-aware segmentation should reflect both the desired granularity and the parts a user wants to extract. Ideally, a practical segmentation model should strive for a simple principle: what you ask for is what you get. However, realizing this goal is hindered by two core obstacles: the lack of multi-granularity training data and the absence of a holistic control mechanism. We propose FLEXPART, a unified framework for text-controlled 3D mesh segmentation. To establish flexible control, we introduce a holistic control prompt comprising semantic part names with location and shape clauses. To support this mechanism, we utilize an automated Vision-Language Model (VLM) pipeline to construct a large-scale dataset of multi-granularity partitions and their corresponding prompts. Driven by this data, FLEXPART generates a view-independent part-identity field in native 3D space, directly assigning discrete part IDs to mesh faces. To compel the model to respect semantic conditions rather than rely on geometric priors, we train the model using randomized background dropping. Furthermore, an inference-time VLM planner can automatically complete descriptive clauses from 2D renderings, allowing users to simply name the desired parts in ordinary words. FLEXPART with planner-completed prompts outperforms the strongest evaluated baseline by 15% in mIoU, even when that baseline receives ground-truth guidance. On our held-out FLEXPARTBENCH, FLEXPART leads at each granularity and improves average mIoU by 22% over the strongest baseline. With only the requested part names supplied by the user, it also improves IoU by 35% over the strongest click-driven baseline on selective segmentation.",

In this work, we study whether language-informed supervision can provide a richer training signal than pixel loss for visual generation. We introduce LILIE (pronounced \"lily\"), a Language-Informed and Lossless Image Encoder. LILIE is an invertible image transform trained such that a vision-language model can recover captions from noised features. The encoder uses a normalizing flow transformer trained jointly with a vision-language model via next token prediction. We then use the encoder to extract a simple language-informed loss for text-to-image generation. We train JiT models with LILIE loss, reducing gFD by 14 points (66.84 $\\to$ 53.01) against a pixel-only baseline on the GPIC dataset.

    "abstract": "While data collection for model training is relatively easy, curating high-quality datasets from large collections is inherently challenging. Coreset estimation methods address this problem by identifying the best data subsets to train models on. However, existing approaches often require proxy model training, extensive annotations, or task-specific tailoring. Unsupervised alternatives typically exploit geometric properties in foundation model feature spaces, but are limited to pairwise image-to-image comparisons or comparisons against a fixed subset. We introduce CoreDNA, an unsupervised, task-agnostic coreset estimation approach that pools neuron activations from vision foundation models into per-image and per-dataset distributions. By comparing each image's distribution to the dataset-level distribution, CoreDNA can capture both low-level visual structure and high-level semantic information across layers. We find that high-quality samples concentrate in the tails of the last layer's activation statistics, which we validate by relating them to training-based coreset methods. Building on these findings, we develop a computationally efficient selection mechanism to construct task-agnostic, high-quality coresets for selective annotation and model training. Across image classification, semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and imitation learning for end-to-end driving and mobile manipulation, CoreDNA matches or outperforms the state of the art, demonstrating unprecedented generalization across perception and action tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness of compact activation-based representations for data selection.",

    "abstract": "Presence-aware intelligence is the capacity of an AI system's intelligence layer to adapt appropriately to the functional state of the person it serves (here readiness, flow, and stability) while preserving task quality and safety. We introduce PresenceBench, an instrument for measuring it. PresenceBench evaluates how the intelligence layer uses a supplied state, not how that state is sensed, and breaks the capability into measurable properties. Two are tested here. Receptivity: does the model take up the state and give a better response than with no signal? Specificity: does any improvement depend on the correct state, rather than on extra structured context? A third, adaptation across states, is a required endpoint not measured in this release. A five-arm causal design answers both questions, against each model's own baseline and an equally structured mismatched-state control, scored by a correctness-gated human paired comparison. The exploratory evaluation covered four models across eighteen single-turn, six fixed three-turn and six simulated natural-conversation scenarios. Supplying a synthetic state, raw or translated into a response policy, gave human-preference point estimates above 0.5 for all four models (Claude Sonnet 5, DeepSeek V4 Pro, Gemini 3.6 Flash, GPT-5.6 Terra), with three of eight 95% intervals excluding chance. Specificity was not resolved: no per-model interval excluded chance, and the design cannot yet separate the state values from a generic instruction to adapt. Policy delivery reduced priced cost and output tokens against each model's baseline; these are resource-use changes, not efficiency gains, because correctness non-inferiority was not established. Safety-floor failures were rare (13 of 360 cases), with a non-significant excess under policy delivery. We report the instrument, the frozen results, and the controls a confirmatory study needs.",

    "abstract": "VRU detection in low-light conditions is a key component in ensuring VRU safety during the most collision prone time of the day. Currently, advances in low-light detection are limited due to the lack of large scale datasets and automated labeling methods. Most autolabeling methods use RGB detections as their labels source, which cannot be replicated in low-light conditions. To fill this gap in this paper we present an automated pipeline for low-light VRU labeling. We use LWIR-RGB image pairs and source our labels from LWIR as VRUs differentiate from the background due to their body temperature. Unlike our previous work that relied on a complex hardware setup to align the two modalities, we perform this experiment using a LWIR-RGB stereo setup, lowering hardware complexity and cost, making the pipeline easier to reproduce. We evaluate method end-to-end on a dataset collected in the capital region of Finland. Models trained on our generated labels beat both off-the-shelf baselines and models fine tuned on a hand labeled subset on F1, mAP@50 and LAMR metrics when tested on a manually labeled dataset, and the result holds for two different LWIR detectors. This shows that low-light VRU autolabeling can be made both accessible and effective without specialized alignment hardware.",

    "abstract": "Identifying small-molecule structures from molecular formulas and tandem mass spectra remains a bottleneck in untargeted metabolomics and natural-product discovery. Even when database retrieval or de novo prediction misses the exact structure, the resulting candidates can provide starting points for exploring nearby structures through a few bond edits. We introduce GEMS (Guided Editing of Molecular Structures), which refines candidates through learned 2-switch bond edits that preserve the molecular formula and each atom's total valence. GEMS uses MIST, a pretrained spectrum-to-fingerprint model, to predict fingerprint probabilities once per spectrum. A neural policy compares each candidate's fingerprint with these predictions, links present features to the atoms and bonds that generate them, and scores all valid edits in one forward pass. The policy is trained on shortest edit paths between structures, so it can be pretrained on PubChem isomers without spectra and then fine-tuned with spectrum-predicted fingerprints. At inference, GEMS searches from multiple initial candidates matching the supplied molecular formula and ranks candidates by fingerprint agreement and multi-start consensus. With the target structure excluded from PubChem initialization, three edit rounds achieve Hit@1/Hit@10 of 29.64%/50.81% on NPLIB1 and 30.22%/41.33% on MassSpecGym, exceeding published baselines under comparable settings. On NPLIB1, GEMS achieves higher identification accuracy in about 3.3 minutes end to end, compared with 26.2 hours for our FRIGID run. GEMS also improves identification from generated candidates, including those refined by FRIGID. Experiments with exact target fingerprints identify fingerprint prediction error as a bottleneck in target recovery and final ranking. Deeper search recovers additional targets without retraining, with larger gains from weaker initial candidates.",

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INRs) have been applied to deformable image registration, where a lightweight network maps a spatial coordinate to a deformation vector. Because an INR encodes one specific signal in its parameters, a fresh network must be optimized for every image pair at test time, which is slow. Existing methods reduce this cost by meta-learning an initialization across a population of image pairs, and condition the weights of the INR globally, so the same conditioning applies at every coordinate while the deformation field it initializes varies across the domain. We propose LUMINR, a meta-learning framework that accelerates this per-pair fitting and in which the conditioning is local instead. LUMINR uses an INR that maps a coordinate, together with local intensity and gradient features, to a deformation vector, so the conditioning varies over the domain at the resolution of the field being modelled. Its objective is to find an initialization of the INR parameters from which the network can be fine-tuned to register any unseen pair in only a few optimization iterations. We evaluate LUMINR on 3D deformable registration of brain MRI from the OASIS dataset, where local conditioning and the meta-learned initialization prove complementary: early in fitting they reach a markedly higher accuracy than either does alone. Fine-tuned from that initialization, LUMINR matches the accuracy of the same conditioned INR fit from scratch in roughly a tenth of the gradient steps and a tenth of the wall-clock time, while the deformation fields stay smooth with negligible folding.",

This study finds that, under self-supervision, models tend to encode dataset-specific structural biases rather than transferable scene geometry, leading to cross-domain optimization conflicts. To address this issue, this study proposes the MaSS framework, aiming to make self-supervised depth learning scalable to diverse data. MaSS introduces a dedicated structural representation pathway explicitly decoupled from contextual features, which is guided by a novel scene-structure discrimination objective to learn generalized, layout-aware structural representations for depth decoding. Trained and evaluated on four diverse datasets, both individually and jointly, MaSS substantially outperforms prior self-supervised methods and is the first to consistently benefit from mixed-domain training. Zero-shot evaluation on eight additional datasets further demonstrates its remarkable generalizability, particularly on those entirely out-of-distribution scenes.

Agent skills provide persistent, transferable capabilities that guide task planning, inform contextual decisions, support tool use, and enable executable procedures.

Inspired by cognitive science, we propose Cognitive Differentiation in Skill Evolution (CDSE), which evolves a unified skill through four functionally distinct yet coordinated components: Meta, Experience, Tool, and Script. CDSE extracts evidence-grounded semantic gradients from successful and failed trajectories, consolidates them by functional role, and applies component-specific updates and validation with cross-component coordination and adaptive invocation. An analysis of 500 top-ranked skill packages shows that 96.8% contain knowledge spanning at least two functional roles. Across six benchmarks, three agent models, and two execution harnesses, CDSE achieves the highest scores in all 36 settings, improving over the Base agent by 7.6 percentage points and the strongest competing method in each setting by 2.6 points on average. Ablation studies further support the importance of functional differentiation and adaptive invocation.",

    "abstract": "Time-aware retrieval is crucial for long-horizon LLM agents to effectively leverage ever-growing long-term memory. Existing methods focus on lexical or semantic similarity, leading to target memories being crowded out by temporally mismatched yet semantically similar candidates. Even time-aware approaches inject temporal cues only during memory organization or answer generation, overlooking temporal constraints at the retrieval stage, where candidate selection occurs - the root cause of the displacement. Inspired by the temporal contiguity effect in human episodic memory, we propose TIDER (Temporal Interval-driven Dual-channel Evidence Retrieval), a time-aware agentic retrieval framework. Central to TIDER is a reinforcement learning (RL)-trained temporal interval locator that infers the temporal windows in which the evidence lies. RL optimizes window localization as a discrete, non-differentiable retrieval decision, using composite rewards to convert sparse answer supervision into fine-grained retrieval feedback. These temporal windows first define the temporal retrieval channel; the retrieved candidates are then merged with results from the semantic channel and reranked by proximity to the windows. This temporal grounding enables TIDER to retrieve temporally aligned evidence that would otherwise be drowned out by the volume of semantically similar yet temporally mismatched memories. With a lightweight 1.7B locator, TIDER achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both long-horizon memory benchmarks - 61.52% on LifeBench (+8.82%) and 78.96% on LoCoMo (+3.66%) - which indicates that temporal cues are crucial for pinpointing target evidence amid a vast pool of semantically similar historical events in long-term daily-life memory.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical agents are commonly evaluated by answer accuracy or proof acceptance. We introduce ClaimScope, a 72-task benchmark for auditing proposed claims through a verdict, scope, counterexample, and repair. Tasks cover optimizer-state transport, finite-horizon affine recurrences, and exact $2\\times2$ linear algebra. We evaluate Qwen3-8B with direct generation and four matched two-pass conditions, each starting from the same draft. A witness checker evaluates only the model's submitted state, without consulting reference verdicts or supplying a replacement witness. Its feedback still conveys information about validity: a verified refutation establishes that the claim is false, and rejection reasons can suggest structural fixes. In this evaluation, verifier feedback yields $23/39$ accepted counterexamples on invalid claims and $25/72$ safe completions, compared with $15/39$ and $20/72$ for checker-free generic feedback. Strict completion remains $17/72$; verdict accuracy changes from $47/72$ to $46/72$. The claim-grouped safe-completion difference is $.094$, with a bootstrap 95\\% interval of $[.000,.198]$. All seven task-level gains follow horizon/input-length diagnostics. A post-hoc schema-only correction of the direct outputs reaches the same 25 safe tasks without another model call.

These systems produce a finished pattern and do not model how a patternmaker turns one pattern into another. In practice a new style is made by editing an existing pattern: lengthening the bodice, moving a dart, swapping a sleeve. Pattern archives record the results of such edits and none of the steps. We observe that the steps can be recovered by searching over editing actions until one pattern becomes the other. A deterministic compiler makes the recovered steps checkable. To this end, we present SemDraft, the first framework that learns to search for executable patternmaking programs from paired before-and-after sewing patterns without recorded editing steps. Specifically, a bounded search recovers a program of editing actions and certifies it only after three checks: it recompiles from scratch, every pair of its actions is classified as ordered or interchangeable, and an independent replay reaches the same pattern. The certified programs then train a model that ranks candidate actions inside the same search. On two frozen draws of 80 order-sensitive cases, with every other search component fixed, the learned ranker certifies 63 and 64 cases within 1,000 search executions, against at most 53 and 52 for non-learned rankers.",

We introduce \\textbf{MYOPIA}, a benchmark comprising four LLM-generated, human-refined decision trees for GTSRB, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MSCOCO, together with matched prompts, diagnostic protocols, and an evaluation harness. Across GPT-4o, Qwen-VL Max, and LLaMA-3.2 11B Vision, tree traversal underperforms zero-shot prompting in all 12 dataset--model pairs; paired bootstrap analyses consistently favor zero-shot. Our diagnostics characterize interacting failure modes associated with this gap. Models often recall tree-encoded class attributes more accurately than they ground the same attributes in images: the mean label--image accuracy gaps are 9.5, 13.8, and 12.6 points for GPT-4o, Qwen-VL Max, and LLaMA, respectively. Incorrect local decisions then irreversibly exclude the correct class, while answer extraction introduces additional model-dependent loss. A node-level audit of the four trees finds that split entropy is weakly but consistently associated with lower node accuracy, whereas depth, branching factor, and within-node grounding differences are less stable. \\textbf{MYOPIA} therefore provides a framework for diagnosing hierarchical visual classification and motivates testing tree designs that prioritize perceptual answerability and recovery from early errors.

Recent work has proposed tool graph memory, which stores past experience as tool transitions to guide subsequent selection. However, it remains unclear whether this component consistently improves agents' tool use or undermines it. We evaluate tool graph memory on nine models and two benchmarks, finding that it seldom improves significantly over baselines, and that its gains, where present, cost over twice the LLM calls. The memory's guidance is often incorrect, and random or no guidance retains most of the gain, implying that the benefit stems from extra computation rather than the memory itself. Moreover, even with the correct next tool suggested, many failures remain, such as giving up without a tool call. Storing the same experience instead as textual insights outperforms tool graph memory with almost no extra LLM calls. This suggests that memory serves better as a soft prior than as a prescription of the next tool, leading to a more effective and generalizable solution.",

We describe a small coverage-closure agent that applies it to an LLM loop: coverage is read from the report that the simulation itself exports (cocotb-coverage YAML) and never taken from the model's account, and data integrity is checked by scoreboards that are separate from the model. On three architecturally distinct RTL designs (an asynchronous FIFO, a UART transmitter and an AHB2APB bridge) the agent raised coverage from 91.7%, 88.9% and 67.4% to 100% within its 8-iteration budget in every logged run, using one design-agnostic agent. A reactive scoreboard monitor attached to the FIFO's base testbench also found a clock-domain-crossing bug in the author's own stimulus code. The monitor is not yet attached to the LLM-generated tests, so their data integrity is not independently checked; one manual check on a single FIFO test is reported as preliminary. We list the weaknesses of this evidence: three designs, no baseline, no ablation, and logged runs that come from several agent checkpoints.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models achieve strong performance in text-to-image generation, but they can still produce unsafe content. Training-free safety guidance offers a practical inference-time alternative that intervenes during sampling without modifying model weights. However, many existing safeguards still rely on a coupled safety-control chain. In this chain, the same unsafe condition simultaneously specifies what should be avoided, indicates the current unsafe signal, constructs the intervention, and determines when that intervention remains active. This coupling can work when unsafe factors are explicit, but becomes less reliable once harmful and benign semantics are entangled in the current generation state, often leaving residual unsafe content or unnecessarily degrading benign-generation quality or prompt fidelity. We address this problem with Decoupled Safety Control (DSC), a plug-in safety-control algorithm for training-free safety guidance. DSC reformulates training-free safety guidance as an explicit state-dependent control process, so the executed intervention is determined from the current generation state rather than inherited directly from a single unsafe condition. Experiments on standard safety benchmarks show that DSC improves representative latent- and text-space safeguards, achieving stronger unsafe-content suppression while preserving benign-generation quality and maintaining efficient inference.",

    "abstract": "On-device deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly adopted due to latency and privacy requirements, but exposes proprietary models to reverse engineering and intellectual property theft. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide hardware-enforced isolation for on-device inference, yet most TEE-based parameter obfuscation relies on unilateral matrix transformations that obfuscate only the output side. We identify a vulnerability in this design, termed the Solution Determinacy Property (SDP): the obfuscation secret is uniquely determined, exposing the structure of the true key and enabling attackers to break the protection. Under our attacks, representative methods GroupCover and ArrowCloak are reduced to negligible protection, with attack accuracy reaching over 2.4 times the full-shielding black-box baseline and recovering near-complete model functionality. To address this vulnerability, we propose BiShield-TEE, a bilateral framework that induces Ambiguous Solutions through joint obfuscation of input and output dimensions, hiding the true key among many equally valid candidates. Experiments across diverse models and datasets show that BiShield-TEE confines attack accuracy to the full-shielding black-box baseline, while achieving higher inference efficiency than prior methods on real hardware.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) deployed as conversational agents are increasingly expected to follow procedural logic. While factual hallucination has received extensive attention, a different failure mode has been overlooked: procedural hallucination, in which an agent produces individually fluent and factually plausible utterances while deviating from the intended conversational process. We introduce DialFork, the first benchmark to measure this failure mode on raw dialogue text. DialFork is built by forking conformant dialogues at controlled turn positions and injecting one of four hallucination types, yielding 36,278 dialogues across 24 tasks in 12 domains; 30 human annotators validate the construction. We define three evaluation tasks that characterize procedural deviation at three granularities: how far a set of dialogues deviates from conformant ones (monitoring deployed agents), how far a single dialogue does (procedural retrieval), and at which turn a dialogue first goes off-track (real-time guardrails). For the first two, we propose dialog-flow-aware metrics, FlowKL and FlowScore, that compare dialogues by how they unfold rather than their content. At the dialogue level, FlowScore significantly outperforms all baselines across seven encoders, showing that semantic similarity is no substitute for procedural similarity. We release DialFork under open licenses at https://github.com/idiap/dialfork, hoping the community will measure conversational process alongside content.",

Given a function of this kind, predictions for a query instance are derived from every training example and then averaged. We propose a version of PDL for the task of classification and propose a suitable meta-learning technique for this purpose. Moreover, we address the problem of uncertainty quantification, i.e., of representing and quantifying the uncertainty of a PDL classifier's predictions in a faithful manner. Building on recent work on the decomposition of total uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components, we propose different ways of extending corresponding measures to the setting of PDL, depending on how and to what extent uncertainty is represented by the underlying base learner. In large-scale empirical studies, we analyze both the predictive accuracy and the uncertainty awareness of our PDL classifier.",

    "abstract": "Muon replaces a matrix gradient by an approximate polar factor and has shown strong empirical performance in neural-network training. The Isotropic Curvature Model (ICM) provides a curvature-based explanation for this update by asking when gradient orthogonalization minimizes a one-step local-loss surrogate. We investigate the stability of this explanation when the fixed input radius of the ICM is replaced by a general radial law. We introduce the Random-Radius Isotropic Curvature Model (RR-ICM) and the Polar-Factor Admissibility Set, which encodes exact scaled-polar optimality as a geometric condition on the positive polar factor of the gradient. We derive an exact characterization of this set for arbitrary radial laws and show that all nonscalar admissible responses arise from radial atoms aligned with curvature kinks. Consequently, every atomless radial law exhibits zero-capacity rigidity: exact scaled-polar optimality is possible only when the gradient is already a scaled column isometry. To connect the curvature-based framework with the established spectral geometry of Muon, we introduce the Minimax RR-ICM by replacing directional averaging with worst-case optimization over probability laws on the sphere. We prove that every nonzero global minimizer lies on the polar ray of the gradient, while its scale is determined by a one-dimensional convex problem. The corresponding admissibility geometry is a positive-semidefinite trace slab, in sharp contrast to the spherical-zonoid geometry of the RR-ICM. Together, these results expose the radial fragility of average-curvature explanations and provide a new minimax variational characterization of Muon's polar direction.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet their susceptibility to backdoor attacks remains a formidable challenge. While existing defenses have evolved from visual-centric patch cues to unsupervised internal attention statistics, they are fundamentally constrained by a reliance on static snapshots and attack-specific heuristics. Given the intricate interplay between dual modalities, the vast design space for multimodal triggers allows diverse threats, such as textual injections, sub-perceptual noises, and coordinated cross-modal triggers, to easily circumvent such rigid priors, particularly when attack types are unknown in real-world applications. In this paper, we rethink backdoor detection by shifting the diagnostic paradigm from static observations to dynamic output evolution. We observe that a successful attack inevitably hijacks the model's decoding trajectory, skewing internal modal contributions during generation while maintaining an abnormal output invariance despite input perturbations. To capture this behavior, we propose EVO-Detect, a unified detection framework that monitors the dynamic evolution of internal signals during early decoding steps through two complementary channels: Attention Flow and Logits Flow. The attention branch measures how image-text attention allocation evolves during early generation, whereas the logits branch quantifies the sensitivity of the output distribution to modal perturbations through interventional ablations. We then convert these trajectories into compact sample-level metrics and normalize them against negative-control signatures so that natural perturbations are less likely to be mistaken for backdoor evidence. Extensive evaluations show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as BYE and TCAP across diverse attack families.",

However, current self-evolution remains particularly challenging in embodied spatial tasks, complex and multi-step decisions from partial visual evidence making it difficult to determine why an execution fails. The failure may stem from misperception, insufficient exploration, or incorrect planning, yet execution feedback alone rarely reveals which component is responsible. As a result, simply accumulating interaction experience can reinforce ineffective strategies. To address this, we propose HiMeco, a brain-inspired self-evolving agent for embodied spatial intelligence, inspired by metacognitive monitoring and hippocampal memory consolidation. Through Hippocampal-Metacognitive Reflection, HiMeco diagnoses failures in perception-exploration-planning (PEP), then compares execution attempts to derive reusable strategies and guidance for avoiding recurring errors. It also abstracts interaction programs into parameterized skills, using evidence contracts and execution-based validation to determine their retention and reuse. These strategies and skills guide subsequent interactions, with memory updated only between rounds and model parameters kept frozen. HiMeco achieves state-of-the-art performance on ESI-Bench, and it also improves accuracy on EmbSpatial-Bench by 3.94 percentage points without evolution.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic-aperture imaging (SAI) removes occluders such as foliage by integrating many views of a scene along a camera path. It has so far been used mainly with frame cameras. We ask whether an event camera has advantages for SAI, and answer the question in simulation, where both sensors see exactly the same scene and the same camera movement. A densely rendered Blender sequence is turned into frames with an EMVA~1288 noise model of an industrial global-shutter camera, and into an event stream with the v2e simulator parameterized like a Sony IMX636. The frames are integrated with the existing airborne optical sectioning renderer. For the events we add a new integration path that projects every single event onto the focal plane at its own interpolated pose, so no events have to be binned into frames. We compare the two sensors in three main runs and an additional dark high-speed test. In a bright scene at 25,m/s the frame camera records only three images on the path and cannot remove the occluder, while the event camera reconstructs the target, even after an event-rate controller drops most of its events to fit the camera link. At the same speed in a 5,lux scene the event camera no longer resolves the target either. In a 5,lux scene at 5,m/s both sensors reconstruct the target at similar quality. We also compare the data one traversal of the aperture costs. At high speed the capped event stream still shows the target at the same data volume as the three frames. At 1,m/s we compare both cameras at two matched data budgets, and there the event camera has no advantage over the frame camera in reconstruction quality. The data rate of the event camera depends on the scene and is highest exactly in the fast bright scenes where it is needed most.",

We introduce CASI (Credit Assignment via Set Intervention for Agentic Retrieval), which constructs the missing counterfactual information through snapshot-grounded set intervention: generate and retrieve once, hold replayable snapshot components fixed, and evaluate alternative subsets under common conditions. Shapley aggregation converts these marginals into within-set credit, which bounded zero-sum advantage shaping incorporates into policy optimization. For m >= 4, singleton, leave-one-out, and full-set endpoints do not generally determine the Shapley allocation; under additive set values, extra coalition evaluations are redundant. In a five-action sponsored-search setting, exhaustive auction replay over 1,200 requests reveals substantial coalition dependence. Under the training-time evaluator, CASI achieves the highest median cosine similarity to a replay-defined Shapley reference among evaluated credit rules; under a sensitivity backend, CASI does not outperform Singleton. Across five independent training runs, CASI-trained policies achieve higher held-out auction-replay set value than Singleton- or Broadcast-trained policies. In a randomized seven-day production A/B test on 10% of traffic, the CASI-trained policy yields an observed 3.51% lift in the primary advertiser-value metric over production control.",

    "abstract": "Correctness feedback suppresses the very evidence that specification-completeness auditing is designed to uncover: programs that satisfy a written contract but violate intended behavior. We demonstrate this objective reversal on 12 Verus/Rust tasks across four model families under matched call budgets. Independent no-feedback discovery more than doubles certified-witness yield relative to IntentShield's corrective-feedback loop (59.0% versus 27.1%). A format-matched iterative control places the larger share of this gap in feedback content, not independent restarts. The advantage holds in every model family and survives parser repair. A separate phase-separated execution matches the aggregate yield without reusing responses; most certified witnesses also fail held-out cases. Preserving these witnesses delivers stronger specification repair: Phase-Revised contracts achieve 81.3% implementation success, versus 62.5% for IS-Revised, with Direct-Revised close behind. Both no-feedback witness sources substantially outperform weakened contracts. The effect does not reproduce in the available Dafny and Lean evaluations, establishing an empirical boundary around the studied Verus/Rust workflow. Completeness auditing and correctness repair have opposing immediate objectives. Preserve and certify the admitted failure before repairing it.",

Our Perception-Memory Fidelity (PMF) Gap-guided OPD-RL framework dynamically balances privileged distillation and task-reward optimization, with periodic teacher updates supporting continued improvement. We further introduce ECHOESBMK, a fine-grained diagnostic benchmark derived from real GUI agent failure trajectories to jointly evaluate visual perception and cross-modal state retention. Experiments on four GUI benchmarks and ECHOESBMK demonstrate substantial gains in task performance and memory fidelity. Without retaining historical screenshots at deployment, ECHOES achieves competitive performance with a favorable performance-inference-cost trade-off and exhibits positive zero-shot transfer to unseen visual planning tasks.",

    "abstract": "Learnable downsampling and spectral-domain filter parameterizations have each made convolutional networks more flexible, but their interaction has not been systematically examined. We bridge this gap by examining convolutional kernels learned in the spatial and spectral domains, together with learned downsampling ratios under a cropped resizing implementation. We find that spectral and spatial kernels respond differently to learned resolution allocation, with larger gains for the spectral kernel. We observe this consistently on three datasets (EuroSAT, CIFAR-10 and STL-10) and at two model sizes (differences in accuracy gain of +0.013 to +0.028 on held-out test sets). Part of this difference reflects the greater gain of the spectral kernel from retaining more spatial area, but the difference remains positive when total retained area is matched. This pattern is observed across datasets and model sizes, although its magnitude and dependence on the complexity budget vary with model size and the resizing implementation.",

Yet effective code-switching requires more than multilingual proficiency: models must decide when, where, and why to switch languages in ways that fit the surrounding context. This context-sensitive ability remains insufficiently evaluated. We introduce CSWBench, a benchmark for evaluating context-sensitive code-switching in creative writing through two complementary settings: Focused Narrative and Extended Narrative. We further propose CSWEval, a theory-informed framework with two complementary levels: event-level evaluation of Licensing, Contextual Appropriateness, and Functional Gain, and whole-text evaluation of task-specific quality---overall literary and narrative quality in Focused Narrative and quality emphasizing multilingual organization in Extended Narrative. Evaluating twelve LLMs, we find that models exhibit meaningful but uneven code-switching competence across narrative contexts. Model differences are particularly pronounced in multilingual literary integration, while multilingual-focused dimensions show stronger difficulty effects overall than the general narrative dimensions; narratively salient switches are associated with stronger contextual and functional realization; and event-level CS quality is moderately associated with whole-text performance.",

    "abstract": "Client-level fair federated learning, in the form of $q$-fair federated learning ($q$-FFL), agnostic federated learning, or tilted empirical risk minimization, has emerged as an attractive solution to equalize utility across heterogeneous clients. This paradigm grants high-loss clients greater relative influence, while a central server aggregates their loss-weighted updates into a single shared model. Yet, the Byzantine robustness of $q$-fair federated learning has been largely neglected, leaving the server unable to tell legitimate fairness-induced amplification from malicious update scaling. To address this critical gap, we formalize the problem of Byzantine-robust $q$-fair federated learning under an \\emph{update-only interface}, in which the server observes nothing but the fairness-scaled client updates. Our analysis under shared class-conditional label skew shows that fairness scaling preserves the nonnegative class-mixture structure of honest updates, while replacing their unit-sum constraint by a client-dependent radial scale. Moving beyond magnitude-based screening, we show that this warped geometry supplies two complementary tests, one radial and one structural, that a single norm cannot provide. We then introduce FUSE, a structure-aware robust aggregator that uses a small trusted labeled dataset for coefficient recovery, scale and cone-consistency screening, and post-screening step-size control. Across four benchmarks and seven Byzantine attacks, FUSE improves seed-wise worst-attack accuracy over the strongest baseline on each benchmark by 3.9--30.1 percentage points, while largely preserving the influence of the high-loss honest clients that fairness is meant to protect.",

    "abstract": "Deploying a general-purpose model as an agent means running it inside a product-specific runtime harness that decides which actions are executable, how state advances, and when the loop may terminate. Ordinary trajectory supervision shows which action was taken but leaves the runtime semantics behind that action implicit. We introduce Harness Policy Distillation (HPD), which makes these runtime control semantics an explicit training target alongside actions to align the harness policy. HPD replays reference trajectories through the harness to recover the runtime semantics that are implicit in ordinary trajectory data, and represents them as control documents at each model-call boundary. These documents provide privileged information for a teacher to generate actions, while harness verification ensures that the resulting targets are executable under the runtime contract. We jointly train a shared model on the runtime semantics recovered from control-state privileged information and native history, thereby internalizing these semantics into the model policy. At deployment, the trained model uses the original harness interface without requiring the control document or any additional supplement. On TRAJECT-Bench with the Pi harness, Qwen3-8B trained with HPD reaches 22.98% autonomous task success and 49.23% runtime compliance, against 3.09% and 19.90% for the unadapted model. Harness-verified teacher actions substantially improve the native deployment policy, while joint control-state supervision provides further gains in task completion and runtime compliance. HPD turns executable runtime semantics into dense supervision for learning harness-compatible actions at each decision boundary.",

    "abstract": "Self-distillation is an emerging approach that trains a model to imitate its own predictions when conditioned on privileged information, such as correct answers or environmental feedback. Recent methods have reported better sample efficiency and generalization than reinforcement learning (RL), but it remains unclear whether these gains extend beyond in-distribution evaluations and whether they stem from privileged distillation. In this paper, we revisit two representative methods, Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO) and On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), across code, science, tool use, and math reasoning tasks. We find that their reported gains do not consistently generalize to unseen problems and are largely explained by overfitting or transferring existing reasoning behavior, rather than effectively using privileged information. Moreover, self-distillation gradients show weak alignment with policy gradients that directly optimize expected reward, questioning whether they provide an effective direction for policy improvement. Our experiments across Qwen3 models (1.7B-14B) and OLMo-3-7B suggest that effectively leveraging privileged information to improve reasoning remains an open challenge.

    "abstract": "System One models such as Jev change how software makes decisions by mapping open-ended semantic contexts into structured judgments that directly drive program execution. However, this paradigm introduces a new security risk, which we term Jev Program Decision Hijacking (JPDH): attacker-controlled contexts can redirect program decisions through schema-valid Jev judgments. Existing evaluations focus primarily on model-level attacks or predefined injection channels, leaving attack reachability and downstream security consequences in real-world Jev applications underexplored. In this paper, we present JevProbe, the first automated framework to evaluate JPDH by tracing adversarial influence from reachable context surfaces through program-consumed decisions to downstream security consequences in real-world Jev applications. Our key insight is that application logic maps diverse Jev judgments to observable decisions, enabling systematic, program-grounded attack evaluation. Across 228 popular real-world Jev applications and 2,273 test cases, 81.5% exhibit decision flips, of which 98.6% lead to potential downstream security impacts. Compared with the strongest adapted baseline, JevProbe improves macro-average Decision Flip Rate (DFR) by 50.4 percentage points, while existing defenses offer limited protection. We further construct JevProbeBench to support systematic evaluation of JPDH in real-world Jev applications. We have responsibly disclosed our findings to Jev application maintainers, pending their responses.

TypeSafe Jev reaches 73.2% source-balanced accuracy including native controls and ranks first or second across all six capabilities, leading beliefs, goals/desires/intentions, and emotions. Other typed models show distinct strengths across tasks. Separate resource comparisons suggest that Jev could reduce the cost and waiting time of repeated ToM selection. Confidence-based selection remains benchmark-dependent, and supplied reasons can repair errors or overturn correct answers depending on their attachment. Candidate expansion reveals distinct selection and output-validity problems. Related-question cues account for most of Jev's downstream gains, with task-dependent effects from predicted states. The findings motivate testing Jev as a ToM selection component in assistants, with task-specific confidence calibration, candidate design, and output validation as integration priorities.",

Existing preference poisoning attacks either corrupt explicit supervision signals or require visible triggers, making them detectable under human inspection. We introduce DPOison-VL, the first clean preference poisoning attack against VLM-DPO, which manipulates model alignment solely through imperceptible perturbations on a small fraction of training images, while leaving all prompts, responses, and preference annotations semantically intact. We formulate poison construction as a bilevel optimization and derive a gradient alignment surrogate that efficiently steers image perturbations toward the attacker-specified preference. We further introduce a preference displacement score for principled poison selection with provable first-order optimality under a fixed poison budget, and derive a sufficient condition for preference inversion. Extensive experiments across diverse attack tasks, different VLM architectures and scales, and baseline comparisons demonstrate that DPOison-VL achieves up to 98\\% ASR with only 2\\% poisoned data and exhibits cross-model transferability, while largely preserving clean accuracy and general utility. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability in VLM-DPO, where imperceptible image perturbations in preference training data can silently redirect alignment.",

We present PrismCodec, which recasts a pretrained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as a bitstream-grounded one-step generative decoder. PrismCodec uses the decoded representation in two complementary roles: a projected codec state defines the starting state for generation, while hierarchical visual priors derived from the same decoded latent provide semantic and structural guidance. To bridge the gap between stochastic, iterative generation and deterministic one-step decoding, we develop a progressive adaptation strategy. We first learn codec-conditioned transport from a noisy neighborhood centered on the codec state, distill it into a one-step mapping, and finally anneal the source perturbation to zero during end-to-end optimization. The resulting decoder reconstructs deterministically from the received representation without additional conditioning bits. Across Kodak, CLIC, and DIV2K, PrismCodec consistently improves rate-perception performance over prior generative codecs, achieving BD-rate reductions of 70-75% in LPIPS and 75-81% in DISTS over StableCodec.

Self-consistency (SC) improves reasoning by voting over sampled final answers, but its vote leaves intermediate disagreements unresolved. To address this problem, we introduce DDRG (Disagreement-Driven Verification Guided by Reasoning Graphs), a framework for selective correction from a frozen bank of reasoning traces. Our insight is that graph alignment can expose claim-level disagreements and provide correction evidence without expanding the sampled trace bank. DDRG builds source-grounded claim graphs and sends localized conflicts to an answer-blind verifier. A verifier-supported refutation that reaches the majority answer's supporting path triggers one focused repair; otherwise, DDRG returns the exact SC vote. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that native zero-shot DDRG improves macro-average accuracy over direct answering by 8.65 and 15.83 percentage points for Qwen2.5-7B and Llama3.1-8B. It also exceeds CoT, the evaluated GoT and GoV question-answering adaptations, and SC on this macro metric. DDRG links local verification to selective correction without enlarging the initial candidate bank.",

    "abstract": "3D part assembly aims to reconstruct a complete shape from a set of unassembled parts by predicting a rigid SE(3) transformation for each part. Because the placement of a part is rarely determined by its own geometry, the task demands reasoning over the entire part set, and existing methods, which rely on pairwise relations or iterative generation and verification, scale poorly to objects with many parts. We present LLM2R, which casts part assembly as sequence modeling with a pretrained decoder-only large language model (LLM): a Point-BERT encoder and a Q-Former compress each part into a block of geometric tokens, the blocks of all parts are concatenated, and a causal LLM adapted with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) processes the sequence in one forward pass. Causal attention, however, lets the hidden states of a part observe only the parts that precede it. LLM2R therefore appends a block of learnable summary tokens after the last part: these tokens follow every part, so their states aggregate the whole assembly at a constant token cost, and a part-aware pose head fuses each part's states with them before predicting its rotation and translation. One architecture thus handles semantic and geometric assembly and predicts all poses in a single non-autoregressive pass. LLM2R achieves the highest part accuracy and success rate on all three PartNet categories, the best rotation error, translation error, and part accuracy on PartNeXt, and the lowest translation error and fastest inference on Breaking Bad, where only a fracture-specialized method is more accurate. Its advantage grows with the number of parts: at 100 parts it exceeds GARF by 33.5 points in part accuracy on Breaking Bad and Assembler by 29.1 points on PartNet, and it transfers zero-shot to unseen categories with more than 16 points higher part accuracy than the strongest of three baselines.",

This paper proposes AgentStripes, an evidence-graded maturity model for AI agents. It defines levels (0 to 7 stripes), process areas (12 areas holding 40 capabilities), three gates (basic, safety, proof) that hold an agent at a level however high its score, and evidence grades E0 to E5. Each applicable capability receives a rating from 0 to 3 and a separate evidence level; these are combined into a credit, aggregated into a severity-weighted score and converted into stripes that the gates limit. Instruments gather evidence, language-model judges interpret it under explicit criteria, and the arithmetic is deterministic. The model is compared with standards at topic level without a claim of conformance, and an unexecuted validation protocol is specified. An empirical evaluation (exploratory, non-confirmatory) of 30 public Python agent repositories, with static evidence only, is a demonstration and not a validation: static evidence caps every final stripe at 2, 26 repositories end at one stripe and 4 at two, and this distinction is unreliable, since re-judging changed the final stripe of 4 of 22 repositories (engine, dossier and panel changed), whereas none of 8 panel-only repeats, all at stripe 1, changed.

We then compare paired runs with real or anonymized company identities while keeping external evidence PIT-valid. Both Qwen and DeepSeek recalled future facts, but neither supported the prespecified shift toward the better-remembered company. Qwen's four allocation estimates on 28 unequal-recall tasks were negative, with descriptive intervals spanning zero. A prospective DeepSeek replication showed an inverse pattern across all four metrics on 20 such tasks, with intervals below zero. These estimates remained negative after each company, pair, and future-fact omission, and all four post-hoc max-T-adjusted sign-flip p-values were below .05. In a prospectively specified follow-up, explicit future facts produced small estimated shifts away from the supplied-fact company, with intervals spanning zero, while final choices shifted toward it. The mechanism behind the natural inverse pattern remains unresolved.

Despite its widespread use, the role of the projector training stage remains poorly understood. We find that (i) using only $10$ to $20\\%$ of the data for training the projector already recovers most downstream performance gains, and (ii) projectors trained on different datasets can be linearly interpolated while largely preserving performance. These results suggest that projector training mainly performs a coarse alignment, which many different projectors achieve equally well. Motivated by these findings, we propose PORTAL, a training-free projector initialization that requires neither paired image-caption data nor gradient-based optimization, but only per-modality summary statistics. PORTAL computes an optimal-transport-based map between Gaussian approximations of the vision and language feature distributions on a shared principal subspace, so that the projector training stage can be skipped entirely. Without any paired data, PORTAL matches the standard pipeline trained on 558k image-caption pairs across six LLM backbones, two vision encoders, and 16 benchmarks. It outperforms that pipeline in $3$ of $7$ (vision encoder, LLM) settings and reaches an average $98\\%$ of its score across the other four.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training improves robot foundation models (RFMs) beyond their demonstrations, but real-world deployment demands more: learning new tasks efficiently while retaining previously acquired behaviors. Existing continual RL methods on top of VLAs mitigate forgetting but rely on on-policy updates with limited forward transfer, whereas off-policy methods improve single-task sample efficiency without addressing learner persistence across tasks. We propose ACCRUE, a continual off-policy RL framework that carries lightweight actor and critic networks across tasks, allowing each stage to reuse behavioral and value knowledge acquired through prior RL. The inherited critic adapts only on current-task transitions and guides current-task actor learning, while prior behavior is preserved by distilling the actor toward cached targets on a small number of retained episodes. Fixed visual features keep the inherited learner and its replay compatible with base-policy updates. Across contact-rich assembly sequences in simulation and on real-robot hardware, ACCRUE accelerates subsequent-task learning with near-zero forgetting and significantly reduces real-robot training time by 31.0\\% to 68.5\\%.",

    "abstract": "Whisper-style ASR models provide strong zero-shot transcription, but their residual errors are not evenly distributed across datasets, recording conditions, and metadata-based groups. We study when lightweight low-rank adaptation (LoRA) improves Whisper and whether observed gains require group-specific adapters. Across Common Voice, LibriSpeech, and VoxPopuli, we compare zero-shot Whisper, pooled LoRA, and group-specific LoRA under matched within-group splits. We find that adaptation is not uniformly beneficial: gains are concentrated in difficult Common Voice groups, are consistent on VoxPopuli, and largely disappear on low-error LibriSpeech. Crucially, pooled LoRA often matches, and sometimes clearly outperforms, group-specific LoRA. Gains over zero-shot should therefore be tested against matched pooled adaptation before being interpreted as evidence of personalization.",

To address this, we introduce ProbabilityBench, a benchmark that provides exact, instance-level class probabilities across three simulated text-based domains: peer review, covert information transfer, and credit risk. By explicitly defining the full data-generating process for each environment, we analytically compute both exact class probabilities and Bayes error. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that rendering these cases into natural-language memos strictly preserves their underlying generative probabilities. This exactness enables direct measurement of reported probability quality via KL divergence. Across 16 evaluated models, most models on the observed cost-quality Pareto frontiers are decision models, including Jev and Perplexity Decider. Finally, ProbabilityBench serves as a meta-evaluation framework, leveraging known ground-truth values to benchmark the accuracy of standard calibration metrics and Bayes-error estimators themselves.",

    "abstract": "Scaling up data and model capacity has driven substantial progress in visual representation learning. However, conventional pretext tasks exhibit diminishing returns on fine-grained facial analysis. We attribute this to a scaling bottleneck: these tasks model each image's appearance and are dominated by identity, pose, and illumination, so subtle within-identity facial differences contribute little to the training signal. We introduce DIME, a differential masked autoencoder for large-scale facial representation learning. DIME builds on a simple observation: two images of the same person share identity-specific appearance, so their difference exposes facial changes. DIME reconstructs both masked images in an identity-matched pair and, through an Explicit Differential Direction Supervision (EDDS) objective, aligns the direction of their reconstructed difference with the true difference, while source isolation makes each reconstruction depend only on its own image. Shared appearance cancels in this difference, and because EDDS ignores magnitude, subtle facial changes count as much as large pose or illumination changes. DIME uses identity labels only to form pretraining pairs, requires no dense annotations, and learns dense facial representations with emergent part-level semantics. We pretrain DIME on 20 million high-resolution facial images consolidated from existing face datasets. DIME's AU detection performance continues to improve as pretraining data scales from 6M to 20M images, with its BP4D F1 increasing by 5.9 points, while MAE gains only 0.5 points on the same subsets. DIME also outperforms specialized facial methods on AU detection, AU intensity estimation, cross-domain anti-spoofing, landmark localization, head pose estimation, face parsing, and face generation.",

    "abstract": "Functional brain connectome represents neural connectivity as a matrix of pairwise interactions between brain regions. Generation of functional connectomes is not only a question of validity; rather, having satisfied the constraints on the correlation matrix, the next step is to recover the class-conditional geometry buried under coarse labels. We propose MAGNET, a Manifold-Aware Graph Diffusion Network which uses a normalized-Cholesky representation of the manifold of correlation matrices that guarantees validity. MAGNET lifts noisy latent states into ROI-level region tokens and performs denoising with a relational inductive bias over brain atlas regions. To deal with structural problems induced by coarse labels, MAGNET employs class-anchored conditioning, amortized structural bridge, and relevance-preserving corruption. Across ABIDE, ADNI, and OASIS-3, MAGNET consistently achieves favorable results compared to previous manifold-aware approaches, demonstrating improvements of 7-21% in class-conditional fidelity ($α,β$-F1) across three cohorts and better sampling efficiency. Moreover, while training only with strict binary labels, MAGNET is capable of maintaining clinical heterogeneity through fine substructure of the connectomes in a zero-shot setting, improving subclass covariance alignment ($λ$-MSE) by over 30%. These results suggest that geometric validity is a necessary but insufficient condition for clinical utility in connectome synthesis. Moreover, efforts in making the diffusion denoising class-conditional manifold aware finds utility beyond the highly curved brain connectome generation as this is a critical problem in various general settings.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong potential for aligning generative models with human intent, but adapting RL to masked generative models (MGMs) remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches that directly adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to MGMs leave a foundational conflict unaddressed: MGMs' exploitative decoding nature is inherently at odds with the exploratory diversity that GRPO presupposes. In this work, we reveal a structural decoding bias termed the visual exploration trap: confidence-based sampling trades the exploration of diverse subject realizations for the greedy resolution of low-uncertainty background regions, causing premature collapse of the generative exploration space and starving GRPO of the rollout diversity it depends on. To this end, we propose MaskSense, a novel RL framework for MGMs that confronts the visual exploration trap at both the sampling and optimization stages. Specifically, we introduce a semantic anchored routing sampling mechanism that leverages semantic priors to preserve high-entropy subject token exploration while amplifying intra-group reward variance through exploratory-exploitative routing to yield more discriminative advantage estimates. Furthermore, we design a global entropy transition anchoring strategy to identify the most consequential decoding steps and concentrate gradient updates on them. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate that MaskSense substantially improves upon the base model, with GenEval accuracy improving from 54% to 86% and HPS from 28.89 to 36.39, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

This paper asks how copyright governance frames and operationalises the protection of such authors, and what a responsible alternative would require. Forty legislative, judicial and soft-law instruments issued between 2019 and 2026 were coded deductively against a framework derived from Responsible Research and Innovation theory, yielding 1,337 category assignments across 835 segments. The European Union and the United States are the primary cases; the United Kingdom, China and international bodies serve as comparators. Normative orientation and the distribution of responsibility dominate the corpus, while reflexivity is the least represented category and reaches its minimum in the US sub-corpus. Both primary jurisdictions frame protection procedurally rather than as an entitlement, and no instrument in the corpus creates a general author-facing attribution duty for the use of works in AI training. From the coded gaps, the paper derives a six-instrument governance design and a capacity-based allocation of responsibility among developers, publishers, collecting societies, funders, institutions, regulators, and individual authors.",

    "abstract": "Deep search enables language agents to solve complex information-seeking tasks through iterative web exploration. However, developing robust open-source agents remains challenging for three reasons. First, opaque trajectory-construction pipelines make training data difficult to audit and reproduce. Second, context compression can create a substantial mismatch between training and inference. Third, agents may retrieve benchmark content from the open web during evaluation, contaminating the results and overstating their performance. To overcome these bottlenecks, we introduce Glasseek, a fully transparent deep search framework spanning the complete development lifecycle, releasing all data, model weights, training recipes, and code. Specifically, for data construction, we establish a verifiable trajectory curation pipeline that systematically generates high-quality exploration paths. For training, we propose Compaction-Managed GSPO (CM-GSPO), which uses the same policy for search and summarization while optimizing only execution sub-trajectories, enabling end-to-end search-policy training across context-compaction boundaries. For evaluation, we conduct the first systematic audit of test-set leakage in open-web agents and release a modular anti-leakage plugin that seamlessly integrates into existing evaluation harnesses. Under this rigorous evaluation protocol, our 9B agent outperforms frontier proprietary agents across almost all deep research benchmarks spanning diverse task types, and achieves the best overall performance among recent open-weight agents, setting a new state of the art at the 9B scale.",

    "abstract": "Tabular data generation aims to synthesize realistic samples from limited observations while faithfully capturing the underlying data distribution. Tabular foundation models (TFMs), pretrained on diverse tabular tasks and adapted through in-context learning, have demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, suggesting the potential of extending this paradigm to tabular data generation. However, the strong predictive performance of TFMs often relies on sufficiently large context sets, whereas tabular generation is typically needed precisely when target data are scarce. Extending the foundation-model paradigm to generation therefore requires reliable distribution inference from only a limited context. To this end, we propose TabGift, a context-efficient tabular foundation model enabling both efficient distribution modeling and effective generation from only a few context samples. TabGift maps heterogeneous tables into a shared latent space with a pretrained tabular encoder, where an in-context diffusion model learns to denoise latent samples conditioned on a small set of clean examples. This design transfers generative priors across datasets and enables distribution inference from limited context, while a lightweight dataset-specific MLP decoder maps generated representations back to the original data space. Experiments on 7 classification and 11 regression datasets show that TabGift consistently outperforms representative baselines in synthetic data quality, with particularly strong gains under limited-context settings, while achieving substantially faster adaptation and generation.",

We introduce a new self-supervised approach that allows us to learn features for topologically complex object categories using a simple prior. Instead of relying on an expensive instance-level analysis by synthesis pipeline, our approach makes use of contrastive learning and distribution matching at the global dataset-level to learn the coarse shape and appearance of a category. Combined with additional geometric losses, this enables us to replicate the global and local statistics of visual features which match those that are extracted from real images. Quantitative results are presented across several challenging object categories, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models show strong potential for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and understanding to excel in long-tail scenarios. However, current VLAs have two limitations: 1) Degeneration into vision-action (VA) models. For low latency, regression/flow-based methods directly generate actions but underuse VLM understanding, causing unsafe, unexplainable actions. 2) Autoregressive high latency. Autoregressive methods sequentially generate chain-of-thought (CoT) and action tokens, fully leveraging VLM understanding, but high latency hinders deployment. To enable low-latency deployment while using CoT to assist action generation, we propose AUGUstus, an Autonomous-driving VLA model with Unified Generation and Understanding. We unify diffusion-based action generation and autoregressive CoT understanding in one model, where understanding only serves generation. Joint CoT supervision preserves VLM spatial understanding in shared representation for safer, more accurate trajectories. AUGUstus-mode orders action generation before CoT, so CoT supervises reliable actions during training while inference needs only action output, enabling low latency. AUGUstus-GRPO, a unified GRPO algorithm, jointly optimizes action and CoT, improving action performance. Experiments show AUGUstus achieves 94.6 PDMS on NAVSIMv1 and 90.7 EPDMS on NAVSIMv2, SOTA planning without scorer module. On nuScenes, it achieves average L2 error 0.27 m and average collision rate 0.05%, best among compared methods. To validate AUGUstus practicality, we train on in-house data with 512 NVIDIA H800 GPUs for ~2 days, evaluate on an internal 1,000 km dataset, and preliminarily deploy on a real vehicle, achieving 12 Hz operation.

Although generative models such as diffusion and flow matching enhance policy expressiveness, they typically start from uninformative Gaussian noise and generate actions through multi-step iteration, leading to high computational costs and failing to effectively leverage suboptimal trajectories in datasets. We propose MeanFlow2Better (MF2B), which reformulates offline RL as generative decision chunk optimization from current performance status to better performance status in a high-level latent decision space. MF2B maps trajectory chunks to high-level latent decision representations through an encoder, placing generation starting points within a structured decision space sculpted by behavioral data. The model learns a shared conditional mean velocity field in this space, constructing two flow mappings: from Gaussian-Induced Decision Sources toward positive behavioral decision regions, and from suboptimal decisions toward high-value decision regions. Both flow mappings complete decision refinement through one-step ODE integration over the unit time interval $Δt=1$, requiring neither multi-step iterative sampling nor backpropagation through time. Furthermore, we propose hierarchical chunk-level advantage to guide the flow direction toward high-return regions, where the high-level decisions cover multiple low-level actions, leading to sequence length compression from $T$ to $K \\approx T/H$ and significantly lower computational overhead. On the D4RL Gym-MuJoCo benchmark, MF2B achieves an average score of 90.91, matching or surpassing strong baselines.",

Because implementations rarely work the first time, PRAISE anticipates common failures and provides a fallback route for each.

This recovery adds $\\leqslant$0.025% to analytical FLOPs, with persistent context storage approximately 1/2,600 that of a Transformer's full MHA KV cache at matched width, depth, and precision. Experiments extend from three 1.3B recurrent backbones to Mamba-2-8B and post-trained Qwen3.5-9B, demonstrating gains on LongBench v1/v2 and MemoryAgentBench. Together, these results show that sparse evidence storage and native replay can substantially expand the long-context capability of pretrained linear attention models while retaining the efficiency of recurrent computation.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare agents must transform longitudinal clinical evidence into reliable actions through heterogeneous tools and stateful workflows, conditions under which model-centric systems may lose context, misuse tools, fail to verify consequential transitions, or cross authorization boundaries. Existing medical-agent benchmarks primarily emphasize terminal task outcomes, making it difficult to determine whether execution failures arise from the agent model, the runtime harness, or their interaction. We present the Medical Harness Protocol, an outcome-preserving framework that independently evaluates seven healthcare-specific process dimensions: Care Action Fulfillment, Clinical Resource Competence, Patient-Evidence Alignment, Clinical Workflow Continuity, Clinical Auditability, Closed-Loop Verification, and Clinical Conduct Boundaries. A normalized intervention trace further tracks whether runtime support is available, activated, delivered, adopted by the agent, and propagated into subsequent behavior. We instantiate the protocol as MedHarnessBench, comprising 342 executable tasks across FHIR/EHR operations, healthcare-administration interfaces, and multimodal clinical tools. Across more than 16,000 controlled task executions, MedHarness yields broad improvements in terminal task success, intermediate subtask completion, and healthcare-specific process quality. We further evaluate MedHarness against multiple general-purpose harnesses and use controlled single-fault perturbations to verify the sensitivity and discrimination of the seven-dimensional evaluation. These results demonstrate that healthcare-specific runtime support can substantially improve both task completion and execution quality, while revealing failures that terminal outcomes alone cannot capture.

    "abstract": "Do genomic foundation models (FMs) provide predictive information beyond simple sequence composition? We evaluate frozen representations from five DNA FMs against normalized k-mer frequencies across 57 genomic classification datasets and two exploratory gene-expression regression tasks. Simple k-mer features remain competitive with most models, whereas NTv3 shows a consistent advantage; the ranking is robust to globally fixed and multi-scale k-mer baselines and alternative downstream probes. To test incremental predictive utility directly, we compare global 6-mer features with their concatenation with each FM embedding under a matched Random Forest protocol. NTv3 improves 46 of 57 datasets (mean $Δ$MCC = +0.072), while Caduceus provides smaller gains and the other models do not improve mean MCC. We separately decompose embeddings into a component linearly predictable from 6-mer frequencies and a ridge residual, finding that linear recoverability does not reliably indicate downstream utility. Exact 6-mer-preserving shuffles further reveal task-relevant sequence-order sensitivity, most pronounced for NTv3, although order sensitivity alone does not guarantee predictive improvements. Our results establish compositional features as essential controls and offer complementary diagnostics for evaluating the added value of frozen genomic representations, without making claims about fine-tuning capacity.",

    "abstract": "Long-term memory for assistants needs a gate that decides when a new utterance retires an old stored claim. Benchmark labels for this step mark a pair as changed or not, so they cannot tell a gate that acts on established change from one that acts on a hint. We write a task contract that separates the two (SUPERSEDED vs. NEEDS-CONFIRMATION vs. COMPATIBLE), label 500 test pairs built from STALE (change pairs plus same-user controls) with three LLM annotators and two human adjudicators (one author and a second annotator; provenance reported), and evaluate Jev, a typed \"System One\" decision model, under pre-registered hypotheses. Of the 179 test pairs STALE marks as changed, 72 meet the contract's bar for an established change. Jev never retired a claim on 141 same-conversation non-changes. Its failure is premature retirement: the binary gate retires 39.2% of claims whose change is only suggested. A three-way decision cuts this to 15.5% at a 15.3-point detection cost, which misses our pre-registered 10-point budget, and it lands on the binary gate's own threshold frontier; these verdicts hold under three readings of the gold labels. On a held-out vault scored against a second annotator's labels, a cascade that escalated uncertain cases to a reasoning model and looked best on development data was indistinguishable from simply raising the threshold (premature retirement 26.8% vs. 6.5% on dev). Part of the gap comes from the gold labels: relative to that annotator's reading, LLM-majority gold shares most of its errors with a same-family escalation model, and an identity for binary labels says how much such shared errors hide. The rest is small-sample selection on development data. For builders this means a binary score should not be wired to delete: route suggested changes to pending evidence, and do not trust a cascade selected on development data of this size.",

    "abstract": "Coding agents based on frozen language models can improve their performance by refining the external context they rely on, without updating model weights. We study recursive self-improvement through behavioral specifications: natural-language code documentation that describes the behavior of program entities and guides agents in generating correct code. We formulate a self-improvement loop in which an agent generates code from its current specifications, evaluates it with execution-verified tests, and refines the specifications based on observed failures. The improved specifications then guide subsequent generation, progressively improving the agent's understanding of the codebase. However, recursive refinement is challenging because program entities are interdependent. Improving the specification of one entity can inadvertently degrade the correctness of others, a phenomenon we call output coupling. This creates a whack-a-mole effect in which local improvements cause regressions elsewhere, preventing consistent progress. We introduce SpecForge, a multi-frontier tree search framework that addresses this challenge with three mechanisms: (i) Pareto-guided state selection preserves complementary specification states and prevents premature commitment; (ii) dependency-constrained entity selection prioritizes callee-before-caller refinement; and (iii) error-diversified expansion explores multiple refinements using different subsets of test failures. On DevEval+, SpecForge achieves the best performance across five backbone models, including a 94.9% solve rate with Claude-4.5-Sonnet and a 5.7-percentage-point average improvement over the strongest baseline. The improved specifications also make the agent better at tasks outside the loop: they transfer to cross-language translation and to new-feature implementation, where they outperform the benchmark-provided requirement documents.",

We call these pivot-derived pairs and propose a confidence layer that lets users choose how strictly each pair is connected. The corpus is machine-generated and not human-verified; quality is expected to vary by language, domain and sentence style, and pivot-derived pairs can inherit errors from both sides.

    "abstract": "Generative modeling for tabular data has advanced to the point where models can synthesize realistic records, recover missing values, and generate samples conditioned on class labels or observed attributes. Despite recent advances, existing approaches either require table-specific training or restrict in-context learning to single-cell prediction. In this work, we formulate these tabular generative tasks as a single problem: modeling the joint conditional distribution of an arbitrary set of target cells given the observed cells of an unseen table. To this end, we turn to diffusion, whose denoising objective is defined jointly over all target cells rather than one cell at a time. Under the pretraining distribution, this objective is minimized by the posterior predictive distribution over the target set. Building on this, we propose TabMosaic, a unified in-context diffusion model for generating mixed-type target cells in unseen, potentially incomplete tables without table-specific training. We further show that its pretraining objective bounds the conditional negative log-likelihood and the divergence from the posterior predictive for arbitrary target sets, extending the Bayesian account of in-context learning from a single-value prediction to joint multi-cell generation. Across 48 real-world tables, TabMosaic ranks first on all evaluated generative tasks against 20 baseline approaches",

Automating these choices is challenging because they are tightly coupled. We introduce FARL (Fully Automated Reinforcement Learning), a framework that automates RL design by jointly searching observation and reward programs, learning algorithms, and training settings. FARL uses training statistics and observed behavior to diagnose failures, propose changes, and test whether they improve learning. Its search preserves diverse candidates and the controls needed for these tests, using a staged budget to screen designs before investing in longer training. Experimental memory records each finding together with its conditions, so an unsuccessful component can be reconsidered in a different combination. Across expert-withheld and expert-available settings, FARL outperforms the evaluated automated baselines on challenging navigation, locomotion, and manipulation tasks. On Adroit Hand Relocate, FARL achieves 97.1% success at 5M training steps per policy, compared with 0% for Eureka and LiMEN and 1.0% for native Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) under the same policy training budget.",

No teacher-generated answer enters the student's training set, so any evaluator-specific trace must pass through a low-bandwidth reward signal rather than copied text. Existing watermarks and distillation detectors do not cover this score-only channel. We introduce Radioactive Feedback, which encodes a registered pattern of behavioral preferences in the rewards themselves. The evaluator applies bounded pointwise adjustments to quality-qualified responses, allowing repeated optimization to transfer the pattern to a student trained by another party.

    "abstract": "Continual learning aims to adapt pretrained large language models (LLMs) to evolving data while preserving their pretrained capabilities. A central challenge is catastrophic forgetting: adaptation to new data can impair performance on previously learned knowledge. Since continual learning commonly changes model parameters, the model's predictions may draw on knowledge from the base model, the parameter update, and the input context. Understanding how these sources interact is essential: conflicts reveal whether new knowledge can override outdated knowledge, while multi-hop reasoning tests whether new knowledge can be composed with existing knowledge to support generalization. We study these interactions in a hypernetwork-based adaptation framework, where a shared network generates adapters from context, allowing a frozen base model to adapt without task-specific updates. We find that, under knowledge conflict, models preferentially follow the context, and their choices depend more on where knowledge is presented than on its content. We also show that context and adapter knowledge perturb the base model's representations along directions orthogonal to its clean hidden states, enabling us to derive steering vectors that control which source the model follows. In multi-hop reasoning, we find that models fail to reliably compose knowledge across the three sources, with the key breakdown arising from the interaction of the hypernetwork with both the base model and the context.

We present a self-defining operator (SDO) that improves with time by updating its operational behavior and memory. When SDO resolves an incident, it distills that experience into playbooks, which describe reusable diagnostic instructions for future incidents with similar faults, and detectors, scripts that take application telemetry as input and output relevant playbook(s). SDO continuously runs the detectors and invokes LLMs only when one fires, so its token cost scales with incident count rather than with operational time. Across 11 open-source microservice applications, SDO cuts resolution time by 52% on recurring faults while keeping per-incident cost low.

Roadside scenes are globally structured yet locally evolving, requiring comprehensive scene-level context while precisely modeling sparse localized motion.

To address this limitation, we propose InfraWorld, a world model formulating roadside occupancy forecasting as selective state evolution. InfraWorld maintains a dense BEV state for the complete scene and persistent motion queries for moving regions, assigning complementary states to global context and local dynamics. Specifically, we propose Dynamic Query Initiation (DQI) to initialize queries in regions supported by motion in the observed history. During rollout, the dense state is updated through Long--Short Temporal Fusion (LST), which combines short-term adjacent-frame continuity with long-term motion trends to preserve stable context while capturing scene evolution. Motion-Aware Query Injection (MAQI) then refines the queries and injects confidence-weighted query information into corresponding BEV tokens, enabling targeted dynamic updates without perturbing global context. Together, InfraWorld concentrates predictive capacity on evolving traffic regions. Extensive experiments on the InfraOcc and Occ3D--nus datasets demonstrate that InfraWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance for roadside 4D occupancy forecasting while retaining its effectiveness under ego-centric settings.

However, existing literature has revealed that some benchmarks may contain shortcut items that can be answered from a single modality or from answer-option regularities alone, thus failing to reflect models' true cross-modal inference ability. Existing methods for assessing benchmarks typically rely either on intrinsic item structure or extrinsic model response behavior, which are not adequate for a comprehensive diagnosis. To fill in this gap, we propose SRCoD, a structure-response co-calibrated diagnosis framework for item-level diagnosis of modality dependence in multimodal benchmarks. SRCoD estimates sample-wise multimodal information structure from benchmark content and target answers, and uses this signal as a soft structural anchor for modality-conditioned item response modeling. The learned model produces a calibrated item-level diagnostic profile that reflects how strongly an item depends on different forms of modality evidence, enabling fine-grained benchmark analysis beyond aggregate accuracy. SRCoD also provides interpretable attribution of the diagnosis results. Extensive experiments under two complementary protocols, i.e., benchmark-refinement oriented validation and human-labeled item validation, demonstrate that SRCoD outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark diagnosis methods.",

In this paper, we first conduct a motivating study revealing that the key issue lies in the insufficient utilization of streaming observations and imprecise target localization. To tackle these challenges, we propose GG-Nav, a simple yet effective navigation framework that learns a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism via supervised fine-tuning to explicitly localize goal-relevant instances, accumulate grounding evidence, and support more reliable decision-making. Specifically, the structured CoT is designed with two key stages: (i) Observation-to-Evidence, which reasons over all intermediate frames between adjacent decision steps to retain useful goal-related evidence; and (ii) Evidence-to-Decision, which integrates the current observation with accumulated evidence to ground the target and support the generation of navigation actions or clarification questions. Extensive experiments show that GG-Nav outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of success rates on the HM3D ObjectNav, VL-LN, and CoIN benchmarks by 3.1%, 16.6%, and 5.3%, respectively. Ablation studies further show that accumulating evidence from intermediate observations reduces evidence-missing failures by 11.6%, while explicit grounding reduces stopping errors by 49.4%. We also deploy GG-Nav on a Unitree Go2 robot, demonstrating its zero-shot generalization capability in unseen real-world environments.",

    "abstract": "Real-world business requests often leave key requirements unstated because frontline practitioners struggle to articulate rules they know from experience. Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) must elicit these requirements through dialogue and iteratively optimize solutions until they meet customer acceptance criteria. Existing optimization benchmarks typically start from explicit objectives, while clarification benchmarks often introduce information gaps into existing tasks. We introduce FDE-Bench, the first benchmark built from real customer projects to evaluate agents on end-to-end delivery tasks that require interactive requirement clarification and iterative optimization. Its 49 cases span combinatorial optimization and machine learning. Clarification targets are distilled from discussions between frontline practitioners and FDEs. Agents elicit missing requirements from a simulated customer, and case-specific evaluators assess final artifacts against acceptance criteria using customer-accepted FDE solutions as quality references. Across 18 agent configurations, the highest mean delivery score is only 0.5510, compared with an FDE reference of 1.0. The highest delivery success rate (DSR), defined as the fraction of planned runs reaching this reference, is only 6.12%. These results show that reliable FDE-level end-to-end delivery remains out of reach for the evaluated agents on underspecified real-world business tasks.

    "abstract": "Multi-robot systems (MRS) offer significant advantages over single-robot platforms by enabling information sharing and coordination for different tasks in complex environments. However, reliable cooperation critically depends on inferring trust over both information sources and their reported hypotheses, particularly under partial observability and potential adversarial interference. Existing approaches frequently depend on pre-established trust relationships or side-channel information, which may not be available or reliable in realistic MRS deployments. This work introduces NeST-Bayes, a neural-symbolic framework that jointly infers robot and hypothesis trust using only inter-robot observation consistency, without requiring preassigned robot trust, reputation information, or side-channel identity signals. NeST-Bayes infers instantaneous trust evidence scores for robots and object hypotheses by reasoning over ego-centric relational graphs constructed from cross-robot observation consistency. These evidence scores are accumulated over time through Bayesian updates of Beta-distributed trust beliefs to maintain temporally consistent trust estimates. Extensive evaluations show that NeST-Bayes achieves the highest mean object precision and robot recall across all benchmark settings, and the highest robot precision and object recall in most settings, compared to trust-based methods. Under aggressive optimized attacks, it achieves 98.8\\% robot precision with 93.8\\% recall and 98.3\\% object precision with 95.4\\% recall. In an occlusion-rich Webots warehouse, it maintains 92.5\\% robot precision with 92.0\\% recall and 97.3\\% object precision with 85.0\\% recall. These results demonstrate joint improvements in the reliability and coverage of retained information.",

Existing TTD methods are overly conservative, making known and unknown features collapse together and difficult to separate during test-time adaptation. In this paper, we revisit TTD from an energy perspective and find that the natural energy gap between known and unknown classes is unstable and easily collapses. We therefore propose Energy Ring to stabilize this gap by anchoring the two types of classes on separate energy rings. A lightweight adapter enlarges the norm-based gap while preserving known-class directions, and a perturbation consistency module forms compact clusters for unknown classes. During testing, energy-guided confidence weighting improves prediction, and a stability-based rectification mechanism corrects unreliable updates. Experimental results show that Energy Ring significantly improves TTD performance against existing TTD methods.",

    "abstract": "During a network forward call, diffusion backbones naturally produce many intermediate activations. If we evaluate each activation against an identical downstream benchmarking protocol, we can plot an inverted-U-shaped curve as the depth profile: the activation's performance goes up first and then down as we go into deeper layers. This is common knowledge in the diffusion model community, which inspires many applications including the widely-adopted REPA. However, the common interpretation of this depth profile may be inaccurate and incomplete: (i) The cause of this curve has long been treated as signal granularity changing from coarse to fine, but there has been little evidence in DiT backbones. (ii) The community has been mainly studying this phenomenon in a static way, without investigating how it changes across different training setups. In this work, we show a different mechanism picture for the profile, where the prediction target (e.g., $ε$, $u$, $x_0$) sits at the center. The semantically meaningful signal is only an intermediate by-product for predicting the target, while the prediction target is the real goal for the backbone. Furthermore, the choice of prediction targets as part of the training setup can predictably affect the curve's shape. With this updated interpretation, many applications of this depth profile can be better grounded and predicted. As an example, we show how to predict the near-optimal placement of REPA based on the prediction target of the training setup. The code is at https://github.com/Darkbblue/dit-compare.",

This has catalyzed the development of machine unlearning to erase harmful concepts or copyrighted styles from a model's generative repertoire without compromising its general performance. However, previous unlearning approaches on diffusion models have largely focused on either object-level or style-level removal and failed to address the challenge of object-style combination unlearning. At the same time, multiple unlearning requests often lead to catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Domain Manifold Unlearning (DMU), which uses an EMA-updated feature proxy extracted from intermediate diffusion features to represent the retained target-object direction. As a lightweight estimating representation of an object, DMU enables selective unlearning of domain-specific components in a specific object while preserving other semantic representations, thereby significantly enhancing robustness in multiple combination unlearning scenarios. Extensive experiments show that DMU significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods of batch unlearning and sequential unlearning.",

TartanMatch adapts an RGB-pretrained correspondence model to all modality pairs within one shared network using lightweight modality adaptation and a mixture of real and synthetic data. On zero-shot real-world benchmarks, TartanMatch reduces Endpoint Error (EPE) over the strongest baselines by 61.9% for cross-modal matching and 49.6% for same-modal matching. We further show that joint training across all modality pairs improves average matching accuracy over pair-specific training, especially on challenging cross-modal pairs. These results demonstrate that a single model achieves broad multi-modal coverage and state-of-the-art matching accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Objective. To evaluate whether spatial context and temporal modeling improve tissue recognition during optical trocar entry, where multiple abdominal-wall tissues may be visible simultaneously. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 71 recordings with 1,516 annotated keyframes and 29,151 clinician-annotated sectors. Each frame was divided into 28 polar-grid sectors assigned to nine tissue classes. Color, neighboring-sector, and positional features were used by a gradient-boosted emission classifier. The full pipeline added learned temporal smoothing, spatial regularization, an anatomically ordered hidden Markov model, and posterior blending. Five-fold cross-validation was grouped by recording, with cross-fitting to prevent within-recording leakage. Primary evaluation used clinician-derived targets; ablations assessed classification, probability quality, spatial consistency, and peritoneum-or-deeper onset timing. Results. The complete pipeline achieved accuracy 0.646, macro-F1 0.507, and macro-AUROC 0.882, versus 0.600, 0.440, and 0.861 for emissions alone. Macro-F1 improved by 0.066 across all five folds. Label changes decreased from 66.2 to 19.5 per sector-minute, and median onset error decreased from 15.58 to 2.45 seconds. Frames with a tissue-depth-code span of at least three decreased from 53% to 26%, versus 22% for clinician annotations. Performance remained limited for preperitoneal fat and bowel, and the full model retained a 44% premature-onset proportion. Conclusions. Combining appearance, spatial context, and temporal constraints improved retrospective tissue recognition and onset localization. Tissue-specific limitations, residual timing errors, and reliance on future observations warrant external validation and prospective evaluation of causal models before clinical use.",

This method is promising in fields such as digital pathology, where many powerful foundation models were proposed recently. However, as we show in this paper, the standard multi-teacher distillation approach reacts poorly to an increase in the number of teachers used to train a student encoder. We demonstrate that learning teacher-specific representations is a key to scaling in MTD. Importantly, different design choices, such as learnable teacher tokens, a tailored attention scheme, additional mixture-of-experts layers and a contrastive loss, are proposed to better learn such teacher-specific representations. We show that our method better scales with respect to the number of considered teachers, allowing us to train compact student encoders, up to 10x more efficient than larger teacher foundation models, while matching their performance and even outperforming them on a large set of tile-level and slide-level tasks. We conduct a thorough empirical validation, evaluating more than 10 foundation models on 39 tasks spanning tile and slide levels. As a result, we release a new collection of strong and efficient foundation models, named OMNI, trained from the knowledge of 10 state-of-the-art foundation models. We finally conduct an analysis of the learned teacher-specific representations, highlighting their complementarity and explaining why they can be easily aggregated at downstream time.",

    "abstract": "Prior research on learning from humans often requires real human demonstrations. But advances in video generation models offer a new paradigm: we can now prompt these generators to make synthetic videos of the task. On the plus side, these synthetic videos take place in the robot's current environment, and do not require actual human teaching. However, while the generated videos appear to show plausible motions, they lack both physical consistency and robot grounding, and thus the robot cannot directly roll out the trajectory shown by the video. In this paper we seek to formalize the process of going from synthetic video generation to real-world robot trajectories for zero-shot manipulation tasks. We recognize that this problem is an instance of constrained optimization. The object trajectories extracted from the synthetic video provide an initial guess at the correct motion, and the robot must refine these trajectories (for instance, within a digital twin) while enforcing physical feasibility and semantic consistency. Our optimization-based formalism provides insights into the video generation properties necessary for success. Specifically, we show that the video generation must probabilistically seed the search within a semantic basin of attraction where the trajectory can be locally modified without losing its task alignment. Our analysis further reveals that state-of-the-art approaches can be viewed as instances of our unified formalism with key simplifications. In our experiments we remove these simplifications to more closely match the underlying optimization, leading to more robust zero-shot trajectories from synthetic videos and improving average task success by 34.1% compared to the best-performing baseline.

    "abstract": "Embodied coding agents construct robot policies from natural-language instructions by generating executable programs and refining them from execution feedback. This refinement assumes that execution feedback reveals whether the task succeeded and, after a failure, provides sufficient evidence to guide program revision. Aerial manipulation violates this assumption in two ways. Payload constraints restrict onboard camera coverage and leave task-critical outcomes outside the robot's view (partial observability), while strong dynamic coupling and limited control margins make physical interactions fragile (limited interaction robustness) and leave failure causes unresolved. Re-examining the same feedback cannot recover observations that were never collected or separate failure causes that the available evidence does not distinguish. To acquire this missing evidence, we introduce Active Feedback (AF), an active \"View and Probe\" framework. When execution feedback leaves unresolved questions, the agent synthesizes a separate diagnostic program that runs in simulation to inspect unseen outcomes from informative viewpoints (View) or test hypotheses about failure causes through targeted physical interactions (Probe). Across six simulated aerial manipulation tasks with 60 trials per condition, AF reduces false completion declarations from 25 to 5 and raises final task success from 31.7% to 75% compared with terminal feedback under the same coding-agent configuration and task-execution limit. Using shared robot APIs, task programs refined with AF in simulation run on a physical aerial manipulator without task-program source-code modification and complete multi-stage manipulation tasks in the real world. These results show that executable diagnosis fills gaps in execution feedback for embodied coding agents, improving both completion assessment and program refinement in aerial manipulation.",

    "abstract": "While learning dexterous manipulation from a single human video offers a promising alternative to costly robot demonstrations, many recent methods predominantly imitate demonstrated motions. Such strict motion matching often limits generalization to initial object poses, goal poses, and grasps not shown in the video. Alternatively, discovering a policy via reinforcement learning (RL) allows for broad generalization, but without prior guidance, it struggles with high-dimensional exploration in complex, multi-stage tasks. To address these coupled generalization and exploration challenges, we present Dex-One2Many, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that learns a generalizable dexterous manipulation policy from a single human video. Our key insight is to abstract the video into sequential scene graphs that guide RL, enabling efficient exploration while preserving broad generalizability. The graphs serve as generative constraints for sampling diverse reset states and provide dense rewards for each stage. Because the graphs constrain relations rather than exact poses, these reset states cover object poses and grasps beyond the video, while initializing each stage from them with dense rewards keeps exploration short and guided. Trained entirely in simulation, Dex-One2Many transfers zero-shot to a real multi-fingered hand. Across five tool-use and manipulation tasks, Dex-One2Many exceeds baselines by 6.5% in seen configurations, while its robust generalization widens this gap to 71% in unseen scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Instruction-guided image editors have become highly capable, yet improving them further still depends on human-edited training pairs or external reward models. Such supervision is costly to obtain and can reward plausible failures: a realistic output may leave the requested change undone or alter content that should be preserved. In this work, we strive to improve a pretrained image editor using only its own generations, without human-edited targets or an external training-time reward model. To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named Rubric-CEPR, that verifies the editor's own samples with its internal representations through a rubric-augmented Contrastive Edit-Preservation Reward (CEPR). A Planner proposes structured edit instructions from unlabeled images, the Editor samples multiple candidate edits, and a frozen Critic scores each candidate with decomposed rubric checks for edit realization, removal of the old state, and content preservation, using features already exposed by the editor. Non-compensatory gates reject infeasible candidates, and the best verified candidate is distilled into the editor through lightweight adapter training. On Qwen-Image-Edit, Rubric-CEPR improves ImgEdit from 4.36 to 4.60 (+5.5%), with a +24.9% gain on object isolation, and transfers to GEdit-Bench and Complex-Edit. The same procedure also improves Step1X-Edit by +7.8% on ImgEdit. We hope our approach will serve as a solid baseline for image editors that improve themselves from their own verified samples.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive decoding is less suited to non-causally ordered data, e.g., cross-references or future dependencies, since their outputs cannot be revised post hoc, unlike iterative human reasoning. Diffusion LLMs partially mitigate this limitation but still cannot flexibly insert or remove arbitrary numbers of tokens from a pre-generated context. We design AutoIndexer as a generative model with a novel training and decoding mechanism that simulates a Chain of Edits, allowing the model to flexibly modify its prior outputs in hindsight via token insertions, substitutions, and deletions. The model learns to predict marker tokens for opening and closing edits, simultaneously moving a cursor to positions in the existing token sequence, analogous to a text editor. Training sequences are obtained by perturbing ground-truth labels with inverse chained edit operations, and the model learns to edit by undoing those inverses. The perturbation training allows AutoIndexer to be robust to erroneous context and adaptable to editing tasks such as code correction. We demonstrate that our method exhibits post-generation context-editing capabilities that most autoregressive and diffusion models lack without compromising performance on standard LLM benchmarks.

    "abstract": "We present DreamTrue, a multi-view, cross-embodiment robot world model for action-faithful and physically plausible video prediction. Training such a model on existing robot datasets faces two obstacles: imprecise calibration can impair action following, while limited coverage of unsuccessful interactions can bias predictions toward successful outcomes. To improve action following across embodiments, we render action trajectories into image-space conditions and introduce offline geometric calibration to align these conditions with the target videos. To broaden interaction coverage, we introduce counterfactual post-training, modifying recorded action trajectories and generating future videos under a wider range of actions and contact configurations. To provide feedback on these predictions without paired ground-truth futures, we construct a human-annotated video dataset covering robot, object, and interaction defects and use it to train an embodied video reward model. Its scores guide reinforcement-learning post-training toward more physically plausible interaction outcomes. On AgiBot, DreamTrue attains state-of-the-art action following, while reducing the human-assessed interaction defect rate from from 48.12% to 6.25%. Notably, our model ranks first in the world model track of the AgiBot World Challenge 2026. The project page can be found at https://brave-eai.github.io/DreamTrue.",

    "abstract": "METR's 50\\% time horizon measures the human completion time of software tasks that an AI solves with 50\\% probability, allowing AI capabilities to be expressed in interpretable units. On 228 tasks and 26 AIs, we recompute the time horizons using splines and item-response theory to relax the assumption that the AI difficulty of a task depends linearly on the log of human time. Our fitted spline can be interpreted as a function that \\emph{converts} human time to AI difficulty; it is nearly flat in a region from 2--30 min but close to linear elsewhere. Hence, a time-horizon jump from 3 min to 30 min is much easier than one from 30 min to 5 hours despite the same multiplier of $10 \\times$. Overall, we contribute time-horizon point estimates that perform better under a cross-validated suite of proper scoring rules, as well as diagnostic plots for assessing time horizons' construct validity. We suggest that time horizons be interpreted together with the diagnostic plots, especially as new time-horizon-based benchmarks are proposed or existing ones grow to include longer tasks.",

    "abstract": "In 2026, cybersecurity evaluations involving OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google agents reached real systems outside their authorized test scope. The paths were different. OpenAI agents exploited research infrastructure, coordinated across runs, and compromised parts of Hugging Face's production environment. Anthropic reported cases in which a misconfigured third-party environment exposed real systems to agents pursuing simulated cyber tasks. In a separately reported evaluation, Google's Gemini accessed three real organizations through an unintended internet route; Google stated that the model stopped in all three instances. Taken together, the cases show why an evaluation cannot rely on an assumed boundary. That boundary must be verified while the agent is operating. This comparative instrumental case study develops a Proactive Agent Security Assurance Cycle (PASAC) and a five-layer Boundary Assurance Stack. The framework combines risk-tiered task design, executable scope contracts, pre-run validation, least-capability access, independent egress enforcement, credential restrictions, cross-run monitoring, automatic stop conditions, and evidence-based reauthorization. A leading-indicator model, nine design propositions, and seven falsifiable hypotheses turn these lessons into a testable research program. Because the public Gemini record is limited to attributed statements and journalism, its detailed causal mechanism remains provisional. The central conclusion is straightforward: proactive agent security requires continuous assurance across the full execution system, not confidence in any single sandbox or safeguard.",

    "abstract": "World models offer a promising alternative to physics-based simulators, yet remain far from practical deployment. We ask how far scaling ego-centric human video takes them, using a dataset of 30,000 hours spanning over 1,000 scene types and 14,000 contributors. Rather than relying on opaque downstream metrics, we directly evaluate agent and object-interaction fidelity on a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark. Increasing training data by 100x improves both, but unevenly: the agent is modeled well, while object fidelity remains far lower and improves slowly. We show that the agent gains need not come from data, and a careful visual conditioning design saturates fidelity with a fraction of it, which lets us measure object fidelity on its own and discover its saturation point. We then introduce a supervision scheme that shifts capacity from scene appearance toward object dynamics, improving object fidelity though a substantial gap remains. Finally, our conclusions transfer to downstream humanoid modeling. Overall, our results suggest that scaling ego-centric data brings agent modeling close to its limit while leaving its effects on the world far behind, and that closing this gap will depend on how models are trained, not only on how much data they see.",

OuroWorld is a mask-free framework that turns any static 3D Gaussian Splatting scene into a 3D cinemagraph: a dynamic scene with vivid, diverse motion looping seamlessly from any viewpoint. A vision-language model infers plausible dynamics and guides a video model to synthesize a reference video, which we lift and complete into multi-view videos. To learn from this imperfect supervision, we propose Inconsistency-Robust Periodic 4DGS: a Fourier-series deformation field guarantees looping by construction, while a Grounded Drift Field anchored at the reference view absorbs cross-view inconsistency. Unlike prior Eulerian methods limited to fluid-like motion, we capture general deformation, object motion, and illumination change. We introduce a ground-truth-free evaluation covering vividness, naturalness, loop seam coherence, and scene quality. On 39 reconstructed and generated scenes, OuroWorld outperforms all baselines and wins 70.8%-99.0% of user-study comparisons. Project page: https://ouroworld.userwei.com",
